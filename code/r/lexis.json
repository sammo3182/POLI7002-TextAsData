{"65": {"text": " Washington: American Enterprise Institute has issued the following news release:  Having drawn venous blood from ObamaCare, Marco Rubio is hunting for an artery.\u00a0 Yesterday, Rubio and Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Finance Committee, accused the Obama Administration of breaking the law with another \"bailout\" of insurance companies. They used data from a new report that they commissioned from the Congressional Research Service to back up their claims.\u00a0 This follows Rubio's successful effort to block the Obama Administration from being able to flow taxpayer funds into the \"risk corridors\" that were meant to help limit the amount of ObamaCare losses that insurance companies could wrack up.\u00a0 These challenges matter. They get to the heart of whether ObamaCare can ever evolve into a more market-based scheme following some radical surgery. Or whether it will limp along as a public entitlement dependent upon mounting piles of subsidies. One of ObamaCare's fundamental flaws is its failure to make health insurance more affordable. Owing to reams of political-minded but costly regulations on what benefits need to be included (and how the insurance plans must be designed) the resulting plans end up being hollow but still expensive, pricing out many consumers.\u00a0 The aim of the political left is to pump up the subsidies offered under ObamaCare, as a way to offset these costs and put ObamaCare into the reach of more consumers. Re-jiggering the risk sharing schemes that Rubio is targeting is a main part of this subsidization. Increasing subsidies is a key feature of Ms. Clinton's health plan.\u00a0 By contrast, the consensus conservative proposal to replace ObamaCare envisions a more competitive market for coverage. It takes its cues from the benefits consumers' want and not the mandates that Washington decrees. The resulting plans won't have all of the same political bells and whistles as the ObamaCare. But more of the resulting plans would be affordable without heavy subsidies. By peeling away these subsidies, Rubio is helping to force this reckoning. It's going to send a clear message to ObamaCare's many constituencies inside and outside industry: They need to get on board with reforming or replacing the scheme, rather than lobbying for subsidies to bail them out of the law's bloated enterprise.\u00a0 The original Rubio provision called the Obama team's bluff after they falsely asserted that the \"risk corridors\" would be budget neutral. Their promise was that these provisions would only shift money away from profitable health plans to help cross-subsidize the plans that experienced greater losses. This is how the law was written. The White House argued that the risk corridors wouldn't skim extra money from the taxpayers. Then they sought to renege on that pledge.\u00a0 Rubio's prior measure held the administration to the plain text of the law.\u00a0 Now Rubio is taking aim at another provision that's being similarly stretched as a way to subsidize ObamaCare's losses. His new letter concerns ObamaCare's \"reinsurance\" program, designed to protect insurers against losses when they get their actuarial math wrong. Under the program, the feds collect money from profitable insurers and then redistribute it to health plans that end up enrolling more high-cost patients, and experience losses.\u00a0\u00a0ObamaCare required that in its first year, the reinsurance program would collect $10 billion to reallocate to insurers. Another $2 billion would to go back to taxpayers. But not enough money was collected. So the Obama Administration, (through regulations) prioritized giving money to insurers over the $2 billion to the Treasury. This sleight of hand once again conflicted with the law's plain reading. \"This is unacceptable,\" Hatch and Rubio write. \"The statute in question is unambiguous, and the&hellip; regulation and recent practice violates its clear directive.\" They point to a report they commissioned from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service to back up their claim that the White House is violating the law.\u00a0 The CRS report found that the Obama Administration's interpretation \"would appear to be in conflict with a plain reading\" of ObamaCare. That text states that the $2 billion \"shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be used for the program established under this section.\"\u00a0\u00a0ObamaCare's proponents want to subsidize their way out of the law's many woes, rather than reveal the law's structurally flawed features. By systematically peeling away ObamaCare's mask of subsidies, Rubio is forcing a constructive reckoning.

working to protect thousands of Pennsylvanians from the damage caused by Obamacare's broken promises - namely, huge premium increases, lack of affordable coverage options, and unfair government fines.\u00a0\u00a0 Initially, President Obama and many Democrats promised that their partisan health care law would lower insurance costs and allow families to keep their health care coverage or choose from multiple options. Today, Pennsylvanians are finding out these promises are being broken.\u00a0 With United Health and Aetna pulling out of the Obamacare exchange, an estimated 173,000 enrollees living in Philadelphia and the surrounding collar counties will only be able to buy insurance from one company. Nearly 60 percent of Pennsylvania counties will have just one or two insurers in operation next year.\u00a0 Meanwhile, all Obamacare enrollees in Pennsylvania face skyrocketing premiums, some as much as 48 percent higher. The Pennsylvania Department of Insurance has received requests for premium rate increases above 10 percent from almost every insurer that is planning to participate in the state's Obamacare exchange next year.\u00a0 In spite of these limited options and higher premiums, Pennsylvanians will still be forced to either buy a costlier, skimpier product, or pay a penalty - more than $2,000 for some households - to the federal government in 2017.\u00a0 That's why Sen. Toomey is sponsoring two pieces of legislation:\u00a0 o The Relief from Obamacare Mandate Act would exempt consumers from the individual mandate penalty when the average Obamacare health insurance premium sold in a state rises by more than 10 percent. o The Protection from Obamacare Monopolies Act would help protect those individuals who live in an area with one or no health care insurers offering plans on the Obamacare exchange from the individual mandate penalty.\u00a0 \"Sadly, the warnings about how Obamacare will harm Pennsylvania families are coming true. Insurers are increasingly finding it better to exit Obamacare than to lose millions of dollars while selling overpriced coverage that most Pennsylvanians do not want and cannot afford, yet are forced to buy,\" said Sen. Toomey. \"This failure of a government-run insurance system was entirely predictable, but hard-working Pennsylvania families should not suffer as a result. These two important bills will ensure that no one is unfairly forced to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars in fines to the federal government because of Obamacare's broken promises.\"  In case

issued the following news release:\u00a0\u00a0 Congressman Lou Barletta, PA-11, today supported legislation that places a repeal of a number of major components of Obamacare on the president's desk for the first time.\u00a0 The legislation, which uses the budget reconciliation process, also places a moratorium on funding of clinics which provide abortions, provides new funding for women's health centers, and reduces the deficit by an estimated $516 billion by 2025.\u00a0\u00a0 The House passed the Senate-amended H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, by a vote of 240-to-181, sending the legislation directly to President Obama's desk.\u00a0 \"Under Obamacare, people have lost their health insurance, doctors have dropped out of practice, and premiums have skyrocketed,\" Barletta said.\u00a0 \"Today we are presenting President Obama with legislation that will begin to repair that damage, if he is willing to hear the cries of Americans asking for relief.\u00a0 He will have to decide whether to sign the bill or put his own legacy before the interests of the people.\"\u00a0 Budget reconciliation is a procedure established by the 1974 Congressional Budget Act, which allows for a budget measure to be considered under an expedited process.\u00a0 The purpose is to enact policies that bring existing revenues and spending into line with a budget resolution passed by both the House and Senate.\u00a0 Budget reconciliation was also used to pass Obamacare in the first place in 2010 without a single Republican vote.\u00a0 \"At the same time we place the bill dismantling Obamacare on the president's desk, we are also stopping the funding of abortion mills and directing new money to clinics which will truly promote the health of women,\" Barletta said.\u00a0 Dismantles Obamacare\u00a0 The legislation broadly disassembles the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.\u00a0 Specifically, the bill:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Repeals the Individual Mandate penalty tax.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Repeals the

Fund (Obamacare Slush Fund).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Repeals Medicaid expansion, premium assistance tax credit, and cost sharing subsidies beginning in 2018.\u00a0 Protects Life\u00a0 In the wake of a series of videos exposing the barbaric practice of profiting from the sale of body parts and organs of unborn infants at the nation's premier abortion provider, the legislation places a moratorium on all mandatory federal funding to certain prohibited entities.\u00a0 The bill defines facilities prohibited from receiving federal money as non-profit providers of elective abortion services receiving more than $350 million in federal funding, a category which includes Planned Parenthood.\u00a0 Protects Women's Health\u00a0 The bill directs $235 million in federal funding to the community health center program in each of the next two years, for a total of $470 million.\u00a0 These community health centers are widely available across the country and provide a range of health-related services, not including abortions.\u00a0 There are more than 9,100 such community health centers nationally, or more than thirteen times the number of Planned Parenthood centers, for example.\u00a0 The legislation also awards grants to states for substance abuse or urgent mental health needs.\u00a0\u00a0 In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact:\u00a0

a new congressional report is a gut punch. It shows that ObamaCare's outlook has worsened considerably as fewer people sign up and costs rise more than expected.To little fanfare and virtually no media coverage, the Congressional Budget Office sharply downgraded its forecast for ObamaCare in its latest report, issued in late March. By just about every measure, things are looking worse than they did a year ago.\u00a0First, the CBO has cut enrollment goals for the ObamaCare exchanges. Its March 2015 report projected that enrollment would top out at 22 million. Now it puts the ceiling at 18 million. And given ObamaCare's track record, even that's optimistic.Lower enrollment numbers should mean lower taxpayer costs, since fewer people will be getting taxpayer-subsidized insurance. But higher-than-expected insurance subsidies are soaking up much of those savings.Last year, CBO projected that the average subsidy would be $4,040. Turns out, it was $4,240.CBO now thinks subsidies will average $4,550 next year instead of $4,250. That is likely a reflection of the fact that premiums leapt this year and are likely to make another big jump for next year.As a result, even though the CBO expects that 4 million fewer people will be getting insurance subsidies in 2024, the total cost of those subsidies paid out that year will stay exactly the same: $99 billion.ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion is also turning out to be far more expensive than planned, forcing the CBO to hike its 10-year Medicaid cost projection by $146 billion. That's largely the result of far more people signing up for Medicaid than expected. Instead of 45 million enrolled in Medicaid this year, as the CBO had been predicting, there are 68 million.In addition, far more workers will find themselves without employer-provided benefits than promised.In its initial report on ObamaCare in 2010, CBO said 3 million workers at most would lose their employer health benefits because of the law.Last year it claimed that 7 million will have lost workplace coverage in a decade. Now it says 9 million will likely be forced off employer plans.And what about the uninsured?When Democrats shoved ObamaCare onto President Obama's desk in 2010, the public was told that it would cut the number of uninsured by 32 million. That number has since dropped 25%.Looked at another way, ObamaCare is now slated to spend $1.94 trillion over the next decade, and yet still leave 1-in-10 Americans without insurance.Oh, and the revenues from ObamaCare taxes will be lower than expected over the next decade, either because they just aren't producing as hoped, or because the White House has delayed various taxes for political reasons. CBO says the employer mandate will raise $12 billion less than it said last year, the individual mandate penalty $6 billion less and the Cadillac tax $28 billion less. (The combination of higher costs and lower revenues, by the way, means those promises about how ObamaCare would not add a dime to the deficit have also proved unreliable.)Repealing ObamaCare wouldn't mean forcing millions off insurance. What it would do is create the opportunity to enact free-market reforms that would actually deliver on ObamaCare's promise of lower costs and expanded coverage.Let's hope voters will understand this when they cast their ballots in November.", "clean_text2": "health reform obamacar taken lot hit late new congression report gut punch show obamacar outlook worsen consider fewer peopl sign cost rise

Services (HHS) is considering spending additional funds for a public relations campaign to prop up the badly failing Obamacare exchanges, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent a letter to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell asking for those valuable resources to instead be used to combat the Zika virus in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Nearly every day brings another set of stories about the dysfunction of the Obamacare exchanges and the negative impact on consumers. For years, the public has read story after story warning of double-digit premium increases in nearly every corner of the country. More recently, we have learned of that Obamacare's onerous rules and poor implementation have caused a number of insurers to withdraw their participation from the exchanges, leading to fewer choices in for consumers in the marketplace. Given these trends, it comes as no surprise that enrollment is well below the projections for this point.\u00a0 \"As the program continues to falter, now we see reports that the administration is working on yet another Obamacare advertising campaign, despite warnings that it will do little to change the fundamental weaknesses in the market place. I am particularly concerned that taxpayer resources could be used for these campaigns at a time when there are higher priority public health needs.\" said Leader McConnell in the letter.\u00a0 McConnell posed a series of oversight questions, including whether the administration would be asking for additional funds, and what expectations the administration had for an ad campaign where previous taxpayer-funded public relations efforts had failed.\u00a0 A full copy of the letter can be found here and below.\u00a0 Dear Secretary Burwell:\u00a0 I write to express my surprise at published news reports indicating that the Administration is planning a new advertising campaign to promote Obamacare's exchanges. I am interested in knowing what resources the Administration believes it has for such a campaign and why it believes that such funds would be better spent propping up the failed Obamacare exchanges than other important public health priorities - such as preventing the spread of Zika.\u00a0 Nearly every day brings another set of stories about the dysfunction of the Obamacare exchanges and the negative impact on consumers. For years, the public has read story after story warning of double-digit premium increases in nearly every corner of the country. More recently, we have learned of that Obamacare's onerous rules and poor implementation have caused a number of insurers to withdraw their participation from the exchanges, leading to fewer choices in for consumers in the marketplace. Given these trends, it comes as no surprise that enrollment is well below the projections for this point.\u00a0 As the program continues to falter, now we see reports that the administration is working on yet another Obamacare advertising campaign, despite warnings that it will do little to change the fundamental weaknesses in the market place. I am particularly concerned that taxpayer resources could be used for these campaigns at a time when there are higher priority public health needs.\u00a0 With this in mind, I would like timely answers to the following questions.\u00a0 1.) Is there a planned advertising campaign regarding the Obamacare exchanges?\u00a0 2.) How many taxpayer dollars does the Administration seek to spend on an Obamacare advertising campaign?\u00a0 3.) Did the Administration request funding for this Obamacare advertising campaign in their FY 2016 or FY 2017 budget?\u00a0 4.) What funds have been appropriated to conduct such a campaign in FY 2016 and FY 2017?\u00a0 5.) Has the Administration identified an alternative source of funding this Obamacare advertising campaign?\u00a0 6.) If the Administration has identified alternative sources of funding for this Obamacare advertising campaign, wouldn't those funds be better allocated to other public health priorities, such as Zika prevention, response, and treatment activities?\u00a0 7.) In earlier years, the Administration spent millions of dollars in taxpayer funds though exchanges on ads of questionable value. Yet those advertising campaigns failed to attract enough young and healthy enrollees to create a sustainable marketplace. Do you expect this campaign to yield a different result?\u00a0 Advertising is helpful when you have a good product to sell that people don't fully understand. Obamacare's problem isn't that it is poorly understood, but rather that people understand all too well that the law costs too much and it isn't working like the Administration promised.\u00a0 I look forward to a timely response to these questions.

release:  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today spoke on the floor of the Senate citing examples of how the president's signature health care plan has broken promises. He warned that unless this fatally flawed law is rolled back then Obamacare would soon become a government-run monopoly and Georgians and all Americans will continue to be without what they were promised: a choice of doctors and health plans, access to quality care, and accountability and transparency.\u00a0\u00a0 To help Georgians affected by higher premiums and reduced choice after insurers have recently been forced to leave the Obamacare exchange, Isakson today co-sponsored two pieces of legislation -- the Obamacare Tax Relief and Consumer Choice Act and the Protection from Obamacare Monopolies Act -- to free the hardworking families who are being hurt by Obamacare's failure from having to comply with the law's unfair mandates and taxes.\u00a0 \"Just last month after Aetna, United Healthcare and Cigna announced they would leave Georgia's marketplace, [and] Blue Cross [Blue Shield] filed its third premium increase for the third time this summer, an increase of 21.4 percent,\" explained Isakson. \"Earlier in the summer, Humana announced the average premium increase in the state of Georgia of a whopping 67.5 percent. And in 2016, all 159 counties in Georgia had at least two provider options. Next year, 96 counties in Georgia will only have one option.\u00a0 \"The numbers do not lie. We cannot rely on going to a government single-payer system. It will bankrupt the country, it will destroy health care and eliminate the choice we all loved as Americans. &hellip;I challenge the Senate to get down to business and do the right thing for the American people and for the people of Georgia that I represent.\"\u00a0 In August, a 21.4 percent rate increase was approved for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia. While Georgians were promised more choice and lower costs of healthcare as a result of Obamacare, the opposite is true. Now, in six out of every ten Georgia counties, the only option for health insurance coverage is Blue Cross Blue Shield, leaving citizens in rural areas without the choices for the coverage that they need.\u00a0 Isakson signed on to the Obamacare Tax Relief and Consumer Choice Act, which creates an exemption from the Obamacare mandate if the average cost for individual or family coverage for the second-lowest-cost silver plan has increased by more than 10 percent from the previous year. It also expands Obamacare's affordability exemption to account for the cost of deductibles and removes Obamacare's tax increases on health savings accounts and allows individuals to use these accounts for over-the-counter drugs.\u00a0 Isakson also co-sponsored the Protection from Obamacare Monopolies Act to allow residents to be exempted from the Obamacare mandate in counties where there is only one or no Affordable Care Act-compliant insurance issuer available, such as in the 96 counties in Georgia now left with only one option for health care insurers.

So why did 1 in 4 of those who signed up in 2015 cancel their insurance plans?\u00a0An official report released last Friday said that enrollment in the ObamaCare exchanges fell to 8.8 million by the end of the year, from 11.7 million who'd initially signed up. That's a 25% decline.About 1.5 million who signed up never paid their first premium, so the number of actual enrollees dropped to 10.2 million by the end of March 2015. Then another 1.1 million canceled their coverage in the last six months of the year, according to an analysis by the Mercatus Center's Brian Blase. Half a million got booted off because they couldn't verify citizenship or immigration status.There's little research on why so many canceled their ObamaCare plans, but it's easy to make a guess.For many, ObamaCare just isn't worth it, even for many of the 84% who get insurance subsidies. The plans typically feature sky-high deductibles. As the New York Times reported, even if the coverage is cheap, it leaves \"some newly insured feeling nearly as vulnerable as they were before they had coverage.\" Why bother paying even heavily subsidized premiums?There's also a built-in incentive to cancel plans before the year is out because of ObamaCare's 90-day grace period, which lets people getting subsidies keep coverage for three months if they stop paying premiums. Plus, the mandate tax penalty kicks in only for those who've been without insurance for three months or more. ObamaCare guarantees that they can get their coverage back the next year -- without making good on their unpaid premiums.Then there are those who've gamed the system -- buying insurance midyear when they have big health care expenses, and then dropping it once the bills are paid. (The administration is trying to crack down on them.)Presumably some drop ObamaCare because they get better coverage elsewhere. Still, since the healthier are more likely to drop out, the ObamaCare risk pool gets sicker, which will add upward pressure on premiums.There's little reason to think that ObamaCare will fare any better this year, particularly since premiums and deductibles shot up. The 12.7 million sign-ups the White House cheered about last month will probably dwindle to less than 10 million by the end of 2016.When you consider that there were 15 million people who were buying insurance on their own before Obama Care, that's a paltry number.", "clean_text2": "health reform presid barack obama describ obamacar great product 1 4 sign 2015 cancel insur plan offici report releas last friday said enrol obamacar exchang fell 8 8 million end year 11 7 million initi sign 25 declin 1 5 million sign never paid first premium number actual enrolle drop 10 2 million end march 2015 anoth 1 1 million cancel coverag last six month year accord analysi mercatus center brian blase half million got boot verifi citizenship immigr status littl research mani cancel obamacar plan easi make guess mani obamacar worth even mani 84 get insur subsidi plan typic featur sky high deduct new york time report even coverag cheap leav newli insur feel near vulner coverag bother pay even heavili subsid premium also built incent cancel plan year obamacar 90 day grace period let peopl get subsidi keep coverag three month stop pay premium plus mandat tax penalti kick without insur three month obamacar guarante get coverag back next year without make good unpaid premium game system buy insur midyear big health care expens drop bill paid administr tri crack presum drop obamacar get better coverag elsewher still sinc healthier like drop obamacar risk pool get sicker add upward pressur premium littl reason think obamacar fare better year particular sinc premium deduct shot 12 7 million sign up white hous cheer last month probabl dwindl less 10 million end 2016 consid 15 million peopl buy insur obama care paltri number", "byline": "", "date": "March 16, 2016 Wednesday", "clean_text": "health reform presid barack obama describ obamacar great product 1 4 sign 2015 cancel insur plan offici report releas last friday said enrol obamacar exchang fell 8 8 million end year 11 7 million initi sign 25 declin 1 5 million sign never paid first premium number actual enrolle drop 10 2 million end march 2015 anoth 1 1 million cancel coverag last six month year accord analysi mercatus center brian blase half million got boot verifi citizenship immigr status littl research mani cancel obamacar plan easi make guess mani obamacar worth even mani 84 get insur subsidi plan typic featur sky high deduct new york time report even coverag cheap leav newli insur feel near vulner coverag bother pay even heavili subsid premium also built incent cancel plan year obamacar 90 day grace period let peopl get subsidi keep coverag three month stop pay premium plus mandat tax penalti kick without insur three month obamacar guarante get coverag back next year without make good unpaid premium game system buy insur midyear big health care expens drop bill paid administr tri crack presum drop obamacar get better coverag elsewher still sinc healthier like drop obamacar risk pool get sicker add upward pressur premium littl reason think obamacar fare better year particular sinc premium deduct shot 12 7 million sign up white hous cheer last month probabl dwindl less 10 million end 2016 consid 15 million peopl buy insur obama care paltri number", "title": "Dumping ObamaCare"}, "88": {"text": " Washington: Office of the MP Tom Cole has issued the following news release:  Since 2010, the health of America has been at the mercy of a flawed, disruptive system. The Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as \"Obamacare,\" has created more problems than the solutions that it had promised. Too many Americans have suffered from skyrocketing healthcare costs - from rising premiums and deductibles, to outrageous hospital visit costs and home care costs. Moreover, the consequences of funding and logistics have been a nightmare for the American taxpayer. The Republican alternative is not a return to the pre-Obamacare status quo, but rather a patient centered, consumer friendly approach to providing affordable, quality health care to all Americans.\u00a0  Without question, our healthcare system before Obamacare was bureaucratic and expensive.  Unfortunately, Obamacare has made it worse on both fronts. It severely reduces our ability to choose our health providers and creates expensive mandates. It has forced people to purchase expensive plans they did not want, and put the federal bureaucracy in charge of one of the most important aspects of a typical American family.  Over the past six years, the House has voted over 60 times to repeal various provisions of Obamacare, and to ultimately repeal Obamacare for good. As a part of those efforts, the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee, of which I am Chairman, has taken firm steps to defund Obamacare. Moreover, Congressional Republicans have offered an alternative to create a superior reform to our healthcare system. The American people should have access to more choices, better treatments, the best doctors, and lower costs. Our nation thrives when we are given market-driven solutions.  The Republican plan allows protections for employer-based health insurance by capping the open-ended tax break and eliminating the erroneous \"Cadillac tax.\" Premiums won't increase and every American of any age will have the flexibility to choose a plan that works for them. More importantly, our plan will preserve Medicaid and Medicare by updating outdated models, reducing costs, and allowing future generations to have the same benefits in the long run. Significantly, the plan will also ensure that research for finding cures is a top priority, and that the National Institutes of Health is robustly funded, something I am proud to support.  No one should ever have to worry that their insurance will be unfairly taken away or that they will be denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition. The number one priority of any healthcare reform should always be the patient. The defining question is simply this - who is in charge of your healthcare, the government or you? I believe in, and am fighting for, you.

In explaining the need for Obamacare, he said this:\u00a0\u00a0 \"[W]hat's happening to your premiums? What's happening to your co-payments? What's happening to your deductible? They're all going up. That's money straight out of your pocket.\"\u00a0 \"So,\" he said, \"the bottom line is this: The status quo on health care is simply unsustainable.\"\u00a0 Simply unsustainable.\u00a0 That was the President's view on the state of our health care system before Obamacare. Here's his view on our health care system six years later.\u00a0 \"Too many Americans still strain to pay for their physician visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles, or pay their monthly insurance bills; struggle to navigate a complex, sometimes bewildering system; and remain uninsured.\"\u00a0 The President wrote that just last month. It sounds an awful lot like what we heard from him years ago, in a pre-Obamacare world.\u00a0 It throws the reality of his partisan law into stark relief. It's not only that Obamacare is failing to live up to the many promises invoked to sell it, it's often making things worse.\u00a0 Just pick up any paper or turn on the news and you'll see that more troubling projections are rolling in when it comes to Obamacare.\u00a0 In fact, each day seems to bring more forecasts of skyrocketing premiums and dwindling choices. It's a trend hitting Americans across the country. For instance, here's the headline people in my home state recently awoke to: \"Get ready to pay more for health insurance in Kentucky.\" The story goes on to warn of Obamacare premium rates that could skyrocket by as high as 47 percent. Nearly 160,000 people are expected to be impacted.\u00a0 Here's a letter from a Louisville man who recently contacted my office. \"How,\" he asked, \"are working class Americans, like myself, able to budget for such drastic changes?\" \"The so-called Affordable Care Act,\" he said, \"is unaffordable.\"\u00a0 He and other Kentuckians are hardly alone in feeling this way. Take Illinois, where premiums could soar by as much as 55 percent&hellip; Or Tennessee and Montana, where some rates could skyrocket by more than 60 percent&hellip;\u00a0 Or Minnesota, where premiums could rise by an average of more than 50 percent&hellip;\u00a0 Minnesota's Democratic Governor said he was \"alarmed\" by these \"drastic increases,\" and called them \"reason for very serious concerns.\"\u00a0 Even my friend the Democratic Leader referred to Obamacare's premium increases yesterday as, quote, \"huge.\" He's right.\u00a0 He was right to mention Obamacare's \"tax increases\" too. This partisan law raised taxes that hit the Middle Class after Democrats promised it wouldn't.\u00a0 So these \"huge\" premium increases aren't the only reason Obamacare is raising costs for the Middle Class. Premiums aren't the only reason that Americans recently cited health costs as their number one financial concern.\u00a0 It isn't hard to see why Americans might be hurting. Taxes are up. Co-pays are up.\u00a0 Deductibles are outpacing wages.\u00a0 And now, with more and more insurance companies pulling out of the Obamacare state exchanges, Americans are being left with another big problem: fewer coverage options.\u00a0 The Obama Administration used to promise us that the Obamacare marketplace would \"provide more choice and control over health insurance options\" and result in \"a significant increase in competition and an array of options for consumers everywhere.\"\u00a0 But that's not the reality for many Americans today.\u00a0\u00a0Obamacare has forced out so many insurers that about one in five Obamacare customers will be forced to find a new insurance company this fall. More than half of the country could have two or fewer insurers to choose from in the exchanges next year, and about a third of all counties in the U.S. -- along with seven entire states -- are set to have just a single insurer offering plans in their area. That includes one county in Arizona that, until just last night, would have had no options in the exchange at all. I know this is something that Senator McCain has been deeply concerned about and he's introduced good legislation to address it.\u00a0\u00a0Obamacare co-ops continue to collapse at every turn too, with less than a third expected to offer plans next year. When these co-ops collapse, they can cost taxpayers millions and disrupt coverage for thousands of enrollees. They can force patients to start over on their deductibles mid-year, even find new doctors.\u00a0 These are the latest reverberating echoes of the president's most famous broken promise \"if you like your health care plan you can keep it.\"\u00a0 Here's a Kentuckian from Campbellsburg, who wrote to me after losing his insurance.\u00a0 \"I lost my health insurance that I had for many years because of Obamacare. Instead of something affordable, I face the possibility of struggling to purchase an Obama health plan that costs two to three times what I had been paying.\" To top it off, he said, the \"process of trying to find coverage has been a nightmare.\"\u00a0 And here's something to keep in mind when Democrats try to spin the American people on Obamacare. For all of this chaos and pain for Middle Class families, Obamacare still has not even achieved its stated purpose of universal coverage. Not even close. Tens of millions still remain uninsured.\u00a0 And those who do have insurance are now discovering that simply having health insurance isn't the same thing as having health coverage.\u00a0 Take one New Jersey man who's suffered for years from chronic migraines and needs medication to help alleviate the pain. The moment Obamacare placed him on Medicaid, he lost access to each of his doctors which meant waiting four months to see a new doctor and get a prescription to the medication he needs.\u00a0 \"You have a card saying you have health insurance,\" he said, \"but if no doctors take it, it's almost like having one of those fake IDs. Your medication is all paid for, but if you can't get the pills, it's worthless.\" *** According to a Gallup poll released just this morning, many more Americans report that Obamacare has hurt rather than helped their families--and many more Americans say that Obamacare will make their family's health situation worse rather than better over the long run. Is it any wonder?\u00a0 Americans were told that Obamacare would allow them to keep the health plans they liked.\u00a0 They couldn't.\u00a0 Americans were told that Obamacare would drive down health care premiums by $2,500 per family.\u00a0 It hasn't.\u00a0 Americans were told that Obamacare would not raise taxes on the Middle Class.\u00a0 It did.\u00a0 Americans were told that Obamacare would increase choice and competition. The opposite is proving true.\u00a0 And remember the promise \"if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor\"? It's been broken too. In fact, the Obama Administration recently erased references to \"keeping your doctor\" from its website.\u00a0 These predictable consequences are not just flukes or quirks of Obamacare. They are not just small wrinkles in the system that will work themselves out with time. They represent fundamental flaws built into this law's original design. Republicans warned about Obamacare's consequences repeatedly from the start.\u00a0 Democrats mocked us for doing so, and rammed through their partisan law anyway.\u00a0 I invite Democrats to now consider following the lead of one of the president's own former health care advisers, who recently penned an op-ed titled \"How I was wrong about ObamaCare.\"\u00a0 The problems Democrats caused for the Middle Class aren't going away until Obamacare does. So if Democrats are serious about helping the Middle Class, they'll work with us to build a bridge beyond Obamacare to better care. Anything else is just more hollow rhetoric. Today, six years on, Obamacare is failing the Middle Class -- but the president still hasn't offered a serious solution to fix it.\u00a0 He's now trying to convince Americans that the solution to his bloated, unwieldy, and expensive law is to make it more bloated, more unwieldly, and more expensive. In other words, more of the same -- just worse.\u00a0 His preferred presidential candidate says the same thing. So do congressional Democrats.\u00a0 How can anyone conclude, after reading all these stories about how Obamacare is hurting the Middle Class, that what we need now is more Obamacare in the form of a government-run plan?\u00a0 Look.\u00a0 Democrats can continue to spin us on how great this law is. They can continue to tell Americans to \"get over\" this law and its pain for the Middle Class. They can continue to laugh at Americans who lose their plans. They can continue to crow about exploiting, quote, the \"stupidity of the American voter\" to push this partisan law on the Middle Class.\u00a0 Or they can work with us to move beyond the failed experiment of Obamacare. They can prove that they are finally willing to put people before ideology. Because this much is clear.\u00a0Obamacare is a direct attack on the Middle Class.\u00a0 It hurts the very people it was supposedly designed to help.\u00a0 It raises costs, crushes choice, and is now crashing down all around us.\u00a0 It simply isn't working.\u00a0 To quote what President Obama said six years ago, \"the bottom line is this: The status quo on health care is simply unsustainable.\"

high costs, reduced choice, and diminishing access to care, Obamacare's failures heated up with the summer sun. Week after week, announcements came that premiums would be rising and coverage options dropping.  Broken promise followed broken promise, leaving American families and job creators at their boiling points.\u00a0  Sadly, these pitfalls are of little surprise and have instead become the status quo as the fundamental flaws of Obamacare become more apparent every year.  Furthermore, a recent Gallup survey found that since Obamacare, fewer American's rate their health status as being in top condition, bad news for Democrats hailing health reform as a success.    While the Obama Administration and Democrats continue to ignorantly sing from the same song sheet, insisting that Obamacare is good for the American people and good for our economy, the American people recognize the need for patient centered reform. Their reasoning is clear: Obamacare has delivered hit after hit to the American people and our economy with sweltering high costs, fewer choices and less access to care.

of the Senator Ron Johnson has issued the following news release:  Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and six other colleagues Wednesday in introducing the State Flexibility to Provide Affordable Health Options Act, legislation that would give states the ability to help their residents who are faced with significant premium increases and limited options on Obamacare exchanges.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I have worked for years to limit the damage and harm done to real people by Obamacare, a partisan policy that promised marketplace competition and higher quality health plans at lower costs and instead delivered the exact opposite,\" Sen. Johnson said. \"This bill would provide necessary relief to Wisconsinites who, under Obamacare, would be penalized for not purchasing a product that they cannot afford or does not meet their needs. It will allow the state to provide Wisconsinites receiving subsidies more options than just those offered on the Obamacare exchanges for 2017.\"\u00a0 While this bill would only apply for plan year 2017 as a temporary step while work continues on efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare with more successful reforms, it would be a significant step to free Americans who are currently suffering the serious negative consequences of Obamacare. It would give states with failing Obamacare exchanges the authority to allow residents to purchase plans outside of the exchanges, even with subsidies. Residents in states that elect to do so will not be subject to the individual mandate.  \u00a0 Projections for 2017 include premiums rising by double-digit percentages and more limited options under Obamacare. Over 30 percent of U.S. counties are expected to have just one insurer offering plans on Obamacare exchanges; four counties in Wisconsin are expected to only have one insurer, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Despite increasing costs and decreasing competition, Americans and Wisconsinites are being forced either to purchase a product that they do not want and cannot afford to use -- or to face a tax penalty.\u00a0 The legislation, introduced by Sens. Ron Johnson, Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), David Perdue (R-Ga.), and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), would:\u00a0     Give states with a failing Obamacare exchange the authority to allow residents to use their Obamacare subsidy to purchase any health plan of their choice, even those off the exchange, for the 2017 plan year.     If the state chooses to use this authority to allow residents to use subsidies outside of the exchange, the legislation will waive the Obamacare law's requirement that you must buy a specific health care plan or pay a fine of as much as $2,000 for a family of four next year.\u00a0  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com ", "clean_text2": "washington offic senat ron johnson issu follow news releas sen ron johnson r wis join sen lamar alexand r tenn six colleagu wednesday introduc state flexibl provid afford health option act legisl would give state abil help resid face signific premium increas limit option obamacar exchang work year limit damag harm done real peopl obamacar partisan polici promis marketplac competit higher qualiti health plan lower cost instead deliv exact opposit sen johnson said bill would provid necessari relief wisconsinit obamacar would penal purchas product afford meet need allow state provid wisconsinit receiv subsidi option offer obamacar exchang 2017 bill would appli plan year 2017 temporari step work continu effort repeal replac obamacar success reform would signific step free american current suffer serious negat consequ obamacar would give state fail obamacar exchang author allow resid purchas plan outsid exchang even subsidi resid state elect subject individu mandat project 2017 includ premium rise doubl digit percentag limit option obamacar 30 percent u counti expect one insur offer plan obamacar exchang four counti wisconsin expect one insur accord kaiser famili foundat despit increas cost decreas competit american wisconsinit forc either purchas product want afford use face tax penalti legisl introduc sen ron johnson lamar alexand r tenn kelli ayott r n h john barrasso r wyo thad cochran r miss mark kirk r ill david perdu r ga rob portman r ohio would give state fail obamacar exchang author allow resid use obamacar subsidi purchas health plan choic even exchang 2017 plan year state choos use author allow resid use subsidi outsid exchang legisl waiv obamacar law requir must buy specif health care plan pay fine much 2 000 famili four next year case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "byline": "", "date": "September 14, 2016 Wednesday", "clean_text": "washington offic senat ron johnson issu follow news releas sen ron johnson r wis join sen lamar alexand r tenn six colleagu wednesday introduc state flexibl provid afford health option act legisl would give state abil help resid face signific premium increas limit option obamacar exchang work year limit damag harm done real peopl obamacar partisan polici promis marketplac competit higher qualiti health plan lower cost instead deliv exact opposit sen johnson said bill would provid necessari relief wisconsinit obamacar would penal purchas product afford meet need allow state provid wisconsinit receiv subsidi option offer obamacar exchang 2017 bill would appli plan year 2017 temporari step work continu effort repeal replac obamacar success reform would signific step free american current suffer serious negat consequ obamacar would give state fail obamacar exchang author allow resid purchas plan outsid exchang even subsidi resid state elect subject individu mandat project 2017 includ premium rise doubl digit percentag limit option obamacar 30 percent u counti expect one insur offer plan obamacar exchang four counti wisconsin expect one insur accord kaiser famili foundat despit increas cost decreas competit american wisconsinit forc either purchas product want afford use face tax penalti legisl introduc sen ron johnson lamar alexand r tenn kelli ayott r n h john barrasso r wyo thad cochran r miss mark kirk r ill david perdu r ga rob portman r ohio would give state fail obamacar exchang author allow resid use obamacar subsidi purchas health plan choic even exchang 2017 plan year state choos use author allow resid use subsidi outsid exchang legisl waiv obamacar law requir must buy specif health care plan pay fine much 2 000 famili four next year case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "title": "Washington: Johnson Introduces Emergency, One-Year Legislation Allowing Wisconsin to Offer More Health Insurance Options Next Year"}, "26": {"text": " Washington: Office of the Senator Pat Toomey has issued the following news release:   U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, is working to protect thousands of Pennsylvanians from the damage caused by Obamacare's broken promises - namely, huge premium increases, lack of affordable coverage options, and unfair government fines.\u00a0\u00a0 Initially, President Obama and many Democrats promised that their partisan health care law would lower insurance costs and allow families to keep their health care coverage or choose from multiple options. Today, Pennsylvanians are finding out these promises are being broken.\u00a0 With United Health and Aetna pulling out of the Obamacare exchange, an estimated 173,000 enrollees living in Philadelphia and the surrounding collar counties will only be able to buy insurance from one company. Nearly 60 percent of Pennsylvania counties will have just one or two insurers in operation next year.\u00a0 Meanwhile, all Obamacare enrollees in Pennsylvania face skyrocketing premiums, some as much as 48 percent higher. The Pennsylvania Department of Insurance has received requests for premium rate increases above 10 percent from almost every insurer that is planning to participate in the state's Obamacare exchange next year.\u00a0 In spite of these limited options and higher premiums, Pennsylvanians will still be forced to either buy a costlier, skimpier product, or pay a penalty - more than $2,000 for some households - to the federal government in 2017.\u00a0 That's why Sen. Toomey is sponsoring two pieces of legislation:\u00a0 o The Relief from Obamacare Mandate Act would exempt consumers from the individual mandate penalty when the average Obamacare health insurance premium sold in a state rises by more than 10 percent. o The Protection from Obamacare Monopolies Act would help protect those individuals who live in an area with one or no health care insurers offering plans on the Obamacare exchange from the individual mandate penalty.\u00a0 \"Sadly, the warnings about how Obamacare will harm Pennsylvania families are coming true. Insurers are increasingly finding it better to exit Obamacare than to lose millions of dollars while selling overpriced coverage that most Pennsylvanians do not want and cannot afford, yet are forced to buy,\" said Sen. Toomey. \"This failure of a government-run insurance system was entirely predictable, but hard-working Pennsylvania families should not suffer as a result. These two important bills will ensure that no one is unfairly forced to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars in fines to the federal government because of Obamacare's broken promises.\"  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact:  editorial@plusmediasolutions.com  ", "clean_text2": "washington offic senat pat toomey issu follow news releas u senat pat toomey r pa chairman senat financ subcommitte health care work protect thousand pennsylvanian damag caus obamacar broken promis name huge premium increas lack afford coverag option unfair govern fine initi presid obama mani democrat promis partisan health care law would lower insur cost allow famili keep health care coverag choos multipl option today pennsylvanian find promis broken unit health aetna pull obamacar exchang estim 173 000 enrolle live philadelphia surround collar counti abl buy insur one compani near 60 percent pennsylvania counti one two insur oper next year meanwhil obamacar enrolle pennsylvania face skyrocket premium much 48 percent higher pennsylvania depart insur receiv request premium rate increas 10 percent almost everi insur plan particip state obamacar exchang next year spite limit option higher premium pennsylvanian still forc either buy costlier skimpier product pay penalti 2 000 household feder govern 2017 sen toomey sponsor two piec legisl relief obamacar mandat act would exempt consum individu mandat penalti averag obamacar health insur premium sold state rise 10 percent protect obamacar monopoli act would help protect individu live area one health care insur offer plan obamacar exchang individu mandat penalti sad warn obamacar harm pennsylvania famili come true insur increas find better exit obamacar lose million dollar sell overpr coverag pennsylvanian want afford yet forc buy said sen toomey failur govern run insur system entir predict hard work pennsylvania famili suffer result two import bill ensur one unfair forc pay hundr even thousand dollar fine feder govern obamacar broken promis case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "byline": "", "date": "September 16, 2016 Friday", "clean_text": "washington offic senat pat toomey issu follow news releas u senat pat toomey r pa chairman senat financ subcommitte health care work protect thousand pennsylvanian damag caus obamacar broken promis name huge premium increas lack afford coverag option unfair govern fine initi presid obama mani democrat promis partisan health care law would lower insur cost allow famili keep health care coverag choos multipl option today pennsylvanian find promis broken unit health aetna pull obamacar exchang estim 173 000 enrolle live philadelphia surround collar counti abl buy insur one compani near 60 percent pennsylvania counti one two insur oper next year meanwhil obamacar enrolle pennsylvania face skyrocket premium much 48 percent higher pennsylvania depart insur receiv request premium rate increas 10 percent almost everi insur plan particip state obamacar exchang next year spite limit option higher premium pennsylvanian still forc either buy costlier skimpier product pay penalti 2 000 household feder govern 2017 sen toomey sponsor two piec legisl relief obamacar mandat act would exempt consum individu mandat penalti averag obamacar health insur premium sold state rise 10 percent protect obamacar monopoli act would help protect individu live area one health care insur offer plan obamacar exchang individu mandat penalti sad warn obamacar harm pennsylvania famili come true insur increas find better exit obamacar lose million dollar sell overpr coverag pennsylvanian want afford yet forc buy said sen toomey failur govern run insur system entir predict hard work pennsylvania famili suffer result two import bill ensur one unfair forc pay hundr even thousand dollar fine feder govern obamacar broken promis case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "title": "Washington: Toomey Supports Bills to Protect Pennsylvanians from Obamacare's Broken Promises"}, "14": {"text": " Washington: Office of the MP Robert Pittenger has issued the following news release:  One of the country's largest health insurers, Aetna, has announced it will stop selling individual plans on Obamacare exchanges in 11 states, including North Carolina. This news comes on the heels of similar announcements made by major health insurers UnitedHealth Group and Humana, both of which are pulling back their Obamacare individual market presence as well.\u00a0\u00a0 In states where insurers are still participating in Obamacare, many are raising premiums again, set to take effect this fall. Thousands of North Carolinians who currently are insured by Aetna through Obamacare exchanges will lose their health plan in 2017.\u00a0 \"From the ironfisted legislative tactics used to pass Obamacare, to the botched website rollout, to the millions of Americans who lost their health plan when the law was implemented, Obamacare has been a disaster every step of the way,\" said Congressman Pittenger.\u00a0 \"This is what happens when government attempts to create its own marketplace - businesses don't show up to sell products. Pinal County in Arizona, for example, will now have zero insurers offering exchange plans in 2017. Before any North Carolinians face the same situation, we need to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a market driven plan offered by House Republicans.\u00a0 \"In just six years following implementation, Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight. The House Republican alternative would offer patients more choice and lower costs, while providing real protection and peace of mind.\"\u00a0 Congressman Pittenger recently wrote an op-ed outlining a comprehensive plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, which can be found here. The plan is part of House Republicans' #BetterWay initiative, which includes hundreds of bold policy solutions and offers a vision for a more confident America. \u00a0  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact:  editorial@plusmediasolutions.com ", "clean_text2": "washington offic mp robert pitteng issu follow news releas one countri largest health insur aetna announc stop sell individu plan obamacar exchang 11 state includ north carolina news come heel similar announc made major health insur unitedhealth group humana pull back obamacar individu market presenc well state insur still particip obamacar mani rais premium set take effect fall thousand north carolinian current insur aetna obamacar exchang lose health plan 2017 ironfist legisl tactic use pass obamacar botch websit rollout million american lost health plan law implement obamacar disast everi step way said congressman pitteng happen govern attempt creat marketplac busi show sell product pinal counti arizona exampl zero insur offer exchang plan 2017 north carolinian face situat need repeal obamacar replac market driven plan offer hous republican six year follow implement obamacar collaps weight hous republican altern would offer patient choic lower cost provid real protect peac mind congressman pitteng recent wrote op ed outlin comprehens plan repeal replac obamacar found plan part hous republican betterway initi includ hundr bold polici solut offer vision confid america case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "byline": "", "date": "August 23, 2016 Tuesday", "clean_text": "washington offic mp robert pitteng issu follow news releas one countri largest health insur aetna announc stop sell individu plan obamacar exchang 11 state includ north carolina news come heel similar announc made major health insur unitedhealth group humana pull back obamacar individu market presenc well state insur still particip obamacar mani rais premium set take effect fall thousand north carolinian current insur aetna obamacar exchang lose health plan 2017 ironfist legisl tactic use pass obamacar botch websit rollout million american lost health plan law implement obamacar disast everi step way said congressman pitteng happen govern attempt creat marketplac busi show sell product pinal counti arizona exampl zero insur offer exchang plan 2017 north carolinian face situat need repeal obamacar replac market driven plan offer hous republican six year follow implement obamacar collaps weight hous republican altern would offer patient choic lower cost provid real protect peac mind congressman pitteng recent wrote op ed outlin comprehens plan repeal replac obamacar found plan part hous republican betterway initi includ hundr bold polici solut offer vision confid america case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "title": "Washington: Pittenger on Aetna leaving Obamacare exchanges"}, "7": {"text": "You have no doubt seen the television ad claiming that Wayne Stenehjem is a supporter of Obamacare. It is simply not true. Wayne has long opposed Obamacare and has a record to prove it.\u00a0In April 2010, Wayne was one of the first attorneys general to join the Florida lawsuit to overturn Obamacare. And Wayne was in the front row when the case was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the 2011 North Dakota special session, legislators wisely chose to not create a state-run Obamacare insurance exchange and opted instead to let the federal government manage the program. Choosing the federal exchange proved to be the right decision as several state-run exchanges have failed.In 2014, Obamacare opponents made yet another attempt to kill it. Their lawsuit, King vs. Burwell, sought to halt tax credits for people signed up through the federal exchange. The impact of this lawsuit on North Dakota Obamacare policyholders would have been devastating. Over 15,000 North Dakotans would have been denied the help they counted on to help pay their required premiums.Wayne decided it was unlikely the Supreme Court would overturn the tax credit and, even if it did, the state would have been confronted with establishing their own exchange or Congress would have to find another way to offset the lost credits. Republicans in the U.S. Senate simply didn't have the votes to repeal Obamacare, a fact we have seen played out dozens of times over the last few years. As a result, Wayne decided to oppose the lawsuit and his decision was validated when the court tossed the lawsuit.Wayne has been consistent in his opposition to Obamacare and has protected North Dakota interests by his actions. Those that claim his support of Obamacare was demonstrated through the King vs. Burwell lawsuit do not have a complete understanding of the situation.Adam Hamm is the North Dakota Insurance Commissioner.", "clean_text2": "doubt seen televis ad claim wayn stenehjem support obamacar simpli true wayn long oppos obamacar record prove april 2010 wayn one first attorney general join florida lawsuit overturn obamacar wayn front row case heard u suprem court 2011 north dakota special session legisl wise chose creat state run obamacar insur exchang opt instead let feder govern manag program choos feder exchang prove right decis sever state run exchang fail 2014 obamacar oppon made yet anoth attempt kill lawsuit king vs burwel sought halt tax credit peopl sign feder exchang impact lawsuit north dakota obamacar policyhold would devast 15 000 north dakotan would deni help count help pay requir premium wayn decid unlik suprem court would overturn tax credit even state would confront establish exchang congress would find anoth way offset lost credit republican u senat simpli vote repeal obamacar fact seen play dozen time last year result wayn decid oppos lawsuit decis valid court toss lawsuit wayn consist opposit obamacar protect north dakota interest action claim support obamacar demonstr king vs burwel lawsuit complet understand situat adam hamm north dakota insur commission", "byline": "", "date": "May 5, 2016 Thursday", "clean_text": "doubt seen televis ad claim wayn stenehjem support obamacar simpli true wayn long oppos obamacar record prove april 2010 wayn one first attorney general join florida lawsuit overturn obamacar wayn front row case heard u suprem court 2011 north dakota special session legisl wise chose creat state run obamacar insur exchang opt instead let feder govern manag program choos feder exchang prove right decis sever state run exchang fail 2014 obamacar oppon made yet anoth attempt kill lawsuit king vs burwel sought halt tax credit peopl sign feder exchang impact lawsuit north dakota obamacar policyhold would devast 15 000 north dakotan would deni help count help pay requir premium wayn decid unlik suprem court would overturn tax credit even state would confront establish exchang congress would find anoth way offset lost credit republican u senat simpli vote repeal obamacar fact seen play dozen time last year result wayn decid oppos lawsuit decis valid court toss lawsuit wayn consist opposit obamacar protect north dakota interest action claim support obamacar demonstr king vs burwel lawsuit complet understand situat adam hamm north dakota insur commission", "title": "Obamacare: Burgum is"}, "37": {"text": "One of the nation's largest insurers recently released a statement announcing its intention to stop offering individual coverage in most Obamacare markets. Aetna's announcement, just six paragraphs long, explained that it had lost more than $430 million on the public exchanges since 2014, thanks largely to too many high-cost (read: sick) enrollees.\u00a0Aetna regretted its decision, CEO Mark Bertolini said in the statement, but doing business in the Obamacare marketplaces created \"significant sustainability concerns.\"It's the same complaint other insurers have voiced about Obamacare, and it mirrors what Bertolini said just two weeks ago in a second-quarter earnings call. But earlier this year, Bertolini let slip another figure that didn't make it into Monday's six paragraphs: Aetna enjoyed a record $6.5 billion in government program premiums in the first quarter.In other words, doing business with the government isn't so bad after all. In fact, it's gotten especially good since Obamacare came along, thanks largely to the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid in most states. Medicaid, like Medicare, offers the best of most worlds for insurers -- it's single-payer, government-financed insurance, and it has low enrollee costs. So while insurers like to gripe about the individual Obamacare exchanges, they have no issues with the big Medicaid profits that Obamacare helps provide.Aetna, at least, seemed to see that big picture not long ago, even calling the Obamacare marketplaces \"a good investment\" in April. What changed? It could be that last month, the Obama administration blocked Aetna's proposed $37 billion merger with Humana. On Wednesday, the Huffington Post revealed a July letter from Bertolini to the Justice Department in which he said that if the merger (and its bottom-line benefits) didn't happen, Aetna would pull out of Obamacare's exchanges.Aetna's about-face, fishy or not, doesn't change that insurers are legitimately losing money in the Obamacare exchanges. That's troubling, but there are remedies available. Lawmakers could find new ways to give insurers financial relief, including making good on old \"risk corridor\" promises to cover insurers' losses on the exchanges. The administration could try to bring more healthy people into the exchanges with tax credits or higher penalties for declining coverage.The government also could pursue a more radical but perhaps overdue solution of linking the plentiful Medicaid and Medicare Advantage dollars that insurers crave to their participation in the Obamacare exchanges.Those measures and others would require approval from a Republican-led Congress that hasn't been inclined to help the Affordable Care Act get better. We hope the 2016 election will change that dynamic because, despite its struggles, Obamacare has done its job of insuring more Americans and slowing the rise of health care costs.Charlotte Observer (Aug. 18)", "clean_text2": "one nation largest insur recent releas statement announc intent stop offer individu coverag obamacar market aetna announc six paragraph long explain lost 430 million public exchang sinc 2014 thank larg mani high cost read sick enrolle aetna regret decis ceo mark bertolini said statement busi obamacar marketplac creat signific sustain concern complaint insur voic obamacar mirror bertolini said two week ago second quarter earn call earlier year bertolini let slip anoth figur make monday six paragraph aetna enjoy record 6 5 billion govern program premium first quarter word busi govern bad fact gotten especi good sinc obamacar came along thank larg afford care act expans medicaid state medicaid like medicar offer best world insur singl payer govern financ insur low enrolle cost insur like gripe individu obamacar exchang issu big medicaid profit obamacar help provid aetna least seem see big pictur long ago even call obamacar marketplac good invest april chang could last month obama administr block aetna propos 37 billion merger humana wednesday huffington post reveal juli letter bertolini justic depart said merger bottom line benefit happen aetna would pull obamacar exchang aetna face fishi chang insur legitim lose money obamacar exchang troubl remedi avail lawmak could find new way give insur financi relief includ make good old risk corridor promis cover insur loss exchang administr could tri bring healthi peopl exchang tax credit higher penalti declin coverag govern also could pursu radic perhap overdu solut link plenti medicaid medicar advantag dollar insur crave particip obamacar exchang measur other would requir approv republican led congress inclin help afford care act get better hope 2016 elect chang dynam despit struggl obamacar done job insur american slow rise health care cost charlott observ aug 18", "byline": "", "date": "August 22, 2016 Monday", "clean_text": "one nation largest insur recent releas statement announc intent stop offer individu coverag obamacar market aetna announc six paragraph long explain lost 430 million public exchang sinc 2014 thank larg mani high cost read sick enrolle aetna regret decis ceo mark bertolini said statement busi obamacar marketplac creat signific sustain concern complaint insur voic obamacar mirror bertolini said two week ago second quarter earn call earlier year bertolini let slip anoth figur make monday six paragraph aetna enjoy record 6 5 billion govern program premium first quarter word busi govern bad fact gotten especi good sinc obamacar came along thank larg afford care act expans medicaid state medicaid like medicar offer best world insur singl payer govern financ insur low enrolle cost insur like gripe individu obamacar exchang issu big medicaid profit obamacar help provid aetna least seem see big pictur long ago even call obamacar marketplac good invest april chang could last month obama administr block aetna propos 37 billion merger humana wednesday huffington post reveal juli letter bertolini justic depart said merger bottom line benefit happen aetna would pull obamacar exchang aetna face fishi chang insur legitim lose money obamacar exchang troubl remedi avail lawmak could find new way give insur financi relief includ make good old risk corridor promis cover insur loss exchang administr could tri bring healthi peopl exchang tax credit higher penalti declin coverag govern also could pursu radic perhap overdu solut link plenti medicaid medicar advantag dollar insur crave particip obamacar exchang measur other would requir approv republican led congress inclin help afford care act get better hope 2016 elect chang dynam despit struggl obamacar done job insur american slow rise health care cost charlott observ aug 18", "title": "Aetna's love-hate Obamacare relationship"}, "51": {"text": " Washington: Office of the MP Vicky Hartzler has issued the following news release:  Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) today voted to save millions of middle class families and seniors from an Obamacare tax hike, relieving them of shouldering the financial burden of the unworkable and unsustainable health care law.\u00a0\u00a0 \"This is another example of just how bad this law is,\" Hartzler said. \"Instead of making health care more affordable and accessible, Obamacare has been raising costs and hiking taxes. To pay for this bad law, Obamacare has penalized middle class families for having high health care costs and has now set its sights on seniors.\"\u00a0\u00a0Obamacare's tax increases hit seniors and middle class families hardest. Prior to passage of Obamacare, Americans could deduct out of pocket medical expenses that exceeded 7.5 percent of their adjusted annual income.  In 2012, 10.2 million families - more than half of which brought in less than $50,000 annually - used this tax provision.\u00a0 After the implementation of Obamacare, this threshold increased to 10 percent for most families, meaning they can deduct less and their tax bill increases. On January 1, 2017 it will also increase for seniors unless it is stopped.\u00a0 \"Americans are looking for relief from high health care costs,\" Hartzler continued. \"Raising their taxes even further is no answer. This bill brings the relief they are searching for by allowing those families who need it most to deduct more of their health care costs from their taxes. Charging people more, especially those who are most vulnerable, is no way to make health care affordable. It is just wrong.\"\u00a0 According to The National Center for Policy Analysis, the average senior spends $4,888 a year on medical expenses, twice as much as the average non-elderly adult. The Joint Tax Committee, a nonpartisan committee of the United States Congress, says the funds raised by this tax increase will have an enormous impact on the budgets of American families who would save on average $200 to $400 a year if this were to become law.\u00a0 Congresswoman Hartzler represents Missouri's Fourth Congressional district in the U.S. House of representatives.

Mostly, though, the new legislation was about the promise of bringing health insurance to millions who couldn't get it.So far, at least, that's exactly what's happening. A New York Times analysis last Sunday found that in 2014, the first full year of Obamacare, low-wage workers and others saw \"historic increases\" in insurance coverage.\u00a0That includes cooks and waitresses, cashiers and hairdressers -- the kind of low-paying and often part-time workers who couldn't afford insurance premiums. Coverage rates also jumped for minorities, who disproportionately work in those low-wage jobs. Hispanics, who make up just 17 percent of the population, accounted for nearly a third of the increase in adults with insurance, the Times reported.Overall, the Affordable Care Act has resulted in about 20 million newly insured adults, according to the administration's estimate. In other words, Obamacare is doing its job.You might find that hard to believe if you've listened to Republicans in Washington and Republicans on the campaign trail. They're still vowing to repeal Obamacare, which they insist is a job killer and the cause of out-of-control insurance costs.But job growth is now the best it's been in two decades, and health care costs -- from Medicare spending per enrollee to family premiums in employer-based coverage -- are growing at a slower rate than before Obamacare, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. In fact, the last four years of premiums account for four of the five slowest growth years since 1999.Health care inflation overall also has slowed, dropping to the lowest level since the government began measuring it more than 50 years ago. In part that's because of Obamacare reforms like those that have reduced hospital medical errors and costly readmissions.That doesn't mean all is rosy with health care. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in January that Obamacare will miss its 2016 enrollment projections, which has insurers nervous about their profits in an already uncertain marketplace.The CBO also projected an $11 billion increase in Obamacare subsidies in 2016, but that's mostly because Congress tried to peck away at the ACA by postponing a \"cadillac tax\" on high-dollar insurance plans and making that tax deductible to employers. Both measures decreased the amount of money Obamacare took in.Obamacare also has a long way to go in providing universal insurance coverage to Americans, but that's in part because 19 states -- including North Carolina -- have declined to expand Medicaid programs for the poor.Instead, the Republicans who encourage that stubbornness continue to crow about killing the ACA. But even a December Senate bill just partially repealing Obamacare would have resulted in about 22 million additional uninsured Americans long-term, according to the CBO.Thankfully, we're seeing the opposite happen. More Americans are enjoying the security of coverage. The health-care gap between the rich and poor is closing, unlike other inequality gaps. Obamacare is working, despite what Republicans say. Someday, perhaps, they'll decide to help it work better.", "clean_text2": "editori appear charlott observ back 2009 enemi call obamacar support afford care act cite least good thing law might could slow cost health care said term price consum pay insur overal medic care inflat most though new legisl promis bring health insur million get far least exact happen new york time analysi last sunday found 2014 first full year obamacar low wage worker other saw histor increas insur coverag includ cook waitress cashier hairdress kind low pay often part time worker afford insur premium coverag rate also jump minor disproportion work low wage job hispan make 17 percent popul account near third increas adult insur time report overal afford care act result 20 million newli insur adult accord administr estim word obamacar job might find hard believ listen republican washington republican campaign trail still vow repeal obamacar insist job killer caus control insur cost job growth best two decad health care cost medicar spend per enrolle famili premium employ base coverag grow slower rate obamacar accord data kaiser famili foundat fact last four year premium account four five slowest growth year sinc 1999 health care inflat overal also slow drop lowest level sinc govern began measur 50 year ago part obamacar reform like reduc hospit medic error cost readmiss mean rosi health care congression budget offic estim januari obamacar miss 2016 enrol project insur nervous profit alreadi uncertain marketplac cbo also project 11 billion increas obamacar subsidi 2016 most congress tri peck away aca postpon cadillac tax high dollar insur plan make tax deduct employ measur decreas amount money obamacar took obamacar also long way go provid univers insur coverag american part 19 state includ north carolina declin expand medicaid program poor instead republican encourag stubborn continu crow kill aca even decemb senat bill partial repeal obamacar would result 22 million addit uninsur american long term accord cbo thank see opposit happen american enjoy secur coverag health care gap rich poor close unlik inequ gap obamacar work despit republican say someday perhap decid help work better", "byline": "", "date": "April 24, 2016", "clean_text": "editori appear charlott observ back 2009 enemi call obamacar support afford care act cite least good thing law might could slow cost health care said term price consum pay insur overal medic care inflat most though new legisl promis bring health insur million get far least exact happen new york time analysi last sunday found 2014 first full year obamacar low wage worker other saw histor increas insur coverag includ cook waitress cashier hairdress kind low pay often part time worker afford insur premium coverag rate also jump minor disproportion work low wage job hispan make 17 percent popul account near third increas adult insur time report overal afford care act result 20 million newli insur adult accord administr estim word obamacar job might find hard believ listen republican washington republican campaign trail still vow repeal obamacar insist job killer caus control insur cost job growth best two decad health care cost medicar spend per enrolle famili premium employ base coverag grow slower rate obamacar accord data kaiser famili foundat fact last four year premium account four five slowest growth year sinc 1999 health care inflat overal also slow drop lowest level sinc govern began measur 50 year ago part obamacar reform like reduc hospit medic error cost readmiss mean rosi health care congression budget offic estim januari obamacar miss 2016 enrol project insur nervous profit alreadi uncertain marketplac cbo also project 11 billion increas obamacar subsidi 2016 most congress tri peck away aca postpon cadillac tax high dollar insur plan make tax deduct employ measur decreas amount money obamacar took obamacar also long way go provid univers insur coverag american part 19 state includ north carolina declin expand medicaid program poor instead republican encourag stubborn continu crow kill aca even decemb senat bill partial repeal obamacar would result 22 million addit uninsur american long term accord cbo thank see opposit happen american enjoy secur coverag health care gap rich poor close unlik inequ gap obamacar work despit republican say someday perhap decid help work better", "title": "What's working?

Alexander said this is \"happening in states all over the country as Obamacare plans and rates get locked in for next year.\"\u00a0 Alexander said that \"Americans have a choice this election. You know exactly what Democrats will do if they are in charge. Democrats will increase Washington's control of your private health insurance choices. Democrats will spend more of your taxpayer dollars to prop up the collapsing Obamacare exchanges.\"\u00a0 Alexander contrasted this approach with what Republicans have proposed.\u00a0\u00a0 \"We want to help Americans struggling with the cost of health insurance immediately. We would do that by giving states more flexibility to give individuals and their families options to purchase lower-cost private health insurance plans outside of Obamacare,\" he said.\u00a0 Alexander pointed out that \"before Obamacare ever became law, Republicans warned President Obama and Democrats in Congress that this would happen.\u00a0 \"In February of 2010, I spoke for Republicans at a White House summit on health care and warned President Obama that premiums for millions of Americans with individual insurance would rise under his proposal.\u00a0 \"But warnings are not much use now. Americans need action.\"\u00a0 Click HERE for video of Alexander's weekly Republican address. The full text follows:\u00a0 I'm Senator Lamar Alexander, from Tennessee.\u00a0 When Tennesseans woke up on Wednesday morning and opened up our state's largest paper, the front page headline read \"Very Near Collapse.\"\u00a0 The story wasn't about a bridge or a foreign dictatorship. \"Very Near Collapse\" was our state insurance commissioner's description of the Obamacare exchange in Tennessee, which more than 230,000 Tennesseans used to buy health plans last year.\u00a0 What does \"Very Near Collapse\" mean in the real world? This November, when Tennesseans are signing up for 2017 Obamacare plans, there will be fewer plans to choose from--and they'll be much more expensive. That picture will be the same for many Americans across the country.\u00a0 Next year, Tennesseans will be paying an intolerable increase--on average between 44 and 62 percent more for their Obamacare plans than they paid last year. Even for a healthy, 40-year-old, non-smoking Tennessean with the lowest-price silver plan on Tennessee's exchange, premiums increased last year to $262 a month. Next year, it's $333 a month.\u00a0 And if you, the policyholder, don't pay all of it, then you, the taxpayer, will, because a large portion of Obamacare premiums are subsidized with tax dollars.\u00a0 Tennessee had to take extreme measures to allow these increases because insurance companies told the state if you don't let us file for rate increases, we will have to leave. If that happened, Tennesseans might have had only one insurer to choose from.\u00a0 That's what's happening in states all over the country, as Obamacare plans and rates get locked in for next year.\u00a0 According to consulting firm Avalere Health, Americans buying insurance in one-third of Obamacare exchange regions next year may have only one insurer to choose from.\u00a0 People buying on Obamacare exchanges will have only one insurer to choose from in five states next year: Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u00a0 Politico reports that one Arizona county is \"poised to become an Obamacare ghost town\" because no insurer can afford to sell health plans on the region's Obamacare exchange. This leaves 9,700 people in Pinal, Arizona, with no Obamacare plan options in 2017.\u00a0 Before Obamacare ever became law, Republicans warned President Obama and Democrats in Congress that this would happen.\u00a0 In February of 2010, I spoke for Republicans at a White House summit on health care and warned President Obama that premiums for millions of Americans with individual insurance would rise under his proposal.\u00a0 But warnings are not much use now. Americans need action.\u00a0 As Tennessee's governor said this week: \"The federal government needs to come in and address the situation. They created the program and so they're going to have to address that.\"\u00a0 In other words, the next Congress--no matter who is president--will have to deal with the mess that Obamacare is causing in our states and the pain it is causing the American people.\u00a0 Americans have a choice this election.\u00a0 You know exactly what Democrats will do if they are in charge. Democrats will increase Washington's control of your private health insurance choices. Democrats will spend more of your taxpayer dollars to prop up the collapsing Obamacare exchanges.\u00a0 Republicans have offered a better idea.\u00a0 We want to help Americans struggling with the cost of health insurance immediately. We would do that by giving states more flexibility to give individuals and their families options to purchase lower-cost private health insurance plans outside of Obamacare.\u00a0 The problem of solving Obamacare takes more than a five-minute radio address. But helping Americans struggling to buy private health insurance plans is something we ought to do immediately.\u00a0 In order to avoid a near collapse of our nation's health insurance market, we need

Collapse\u00e2[#x20ac]"}, "61": {"text": " Washington: Office of the Senator Rob Portman has issued the following news release:  U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) joined a group of seven other United States Senators today to introduce emergency, one-year legislation that would give states the authority to allow Americans who rely on Obamacare subsidies to have more options to buy health insurance unavailable on the failing Obamacare exchanges, and waive any penalty if they do not find a plan that suits their or their family's needs.\u00a0\u00a0 Senator Portman (R-OH) said: \"Ohioans need immediate relief from the skyrocketing cost of Obamacare. Premiums have increased in Ohio more than 90 percent since the president's health care law went into place. This bill would provide individuals who have suffered under the high costs and fewer choices of Obamacare more options to receive coverage--which means more competition which in turn brings down costs. After eight years of stagnating wages, slow economic growth, and a rising cost of living, Ohioans deserve the relief this legislation would provide, not a health care system they can't afford.\"\u00a0 Senate health committee chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN) said: \"If you aren't on Medicare or Medicaid and don't obtain your health insurance through your employer, you are probably one of the nearly 11 million Americans who purchase their insurance on their own through the Obamacare exchange in your state. And you've probably read in the news that rates may be 60 percent higher next year than they were this year for the same insurance policy. And come November, nearly a third of the nation's counties will have only one insurer for you to choose from when you have to buy health insurance on the regional Obamacare exchange as the market collapses and insurance companies are leaving the Obamacare exchanges in droves. This legislation would allow your state to give you the option of buying health insurance wherever you can find it whether on or off the Obamacare exchange.\"\u00a0 \"This one-year solution is not a substitute for the long-term need to repeal and replace Obamacare with step-by-step reforms that transform the health care delivery system by putting patients in charge, giving them more choices and reducing the cost of health care so that more people can afford it,\" he continued. \"That would require a Republican president next year, but it gives Americans a real solution for next year and lets them know that we are on their side. Even if we have a Democratic president next year, we cannot continue without making big, structural changes soon to avoid a collapse of our nation's health insurance market.\"\u00a0 Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) said: \"More than 11,000 people in my home state recently learned that they would have to find a new health care plan after an insurer announced that it would be leaving the New Hampshire partnership exchange next year. Higher premiums and fewer choices are impacting real people today, and hardworking Granite Staters can't afford to keep taking these hits. Our legislation would provide a temporary means to lessen the burdens of ObamaCare on New Hampshire families and individuals by allowing eligible individuals to use a subsidy to purchase health insurance outside of the exchanges, which may offer less expensive options than plans available through the exchanges.  This bill will help bring back some much-needed flexibility and choice in the health insurance marketplace, both of which ObamaCare has limited.\"\u00a0 Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) said: \"In more than half of all counties in America, there will be only be two or fewer carriers offering coverage on the Obamacare exchange. Hard-working families facing higher premiums because of Obamacare deserve relief.  This legislation will give families more choices in 2017, as Republicans work to replace this failed law with real reforms that will make health care more affordable for all Americans.\"\u00a0 Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) said: \"Time has shown that Obamacare is resulting in fewer and more expensive choices for the American people.  This legislation would increase options for families in Mississippi and elsewhere to obtain health insurance without being locked into troubled Obamacare exchanges,\"\u00a0 Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) said: \"I have worked for years to limit the damage and harm done to real people by Obamacare, a partisan policy that promised marketplace competition and higher quality health plans at lower costs and instead delivered the exact opposite. This bill would provide necessary relief to Wisconsinites who, under Obamacare, would be penalized for not purchasing a product that they cannot afford or does not meet their needs. It will allow the state to provide Wisconsinites receiving subsidies more options than just those offered on the Obamacare exchanges for 2017.\"                                              \u00a0 The legislation, introduced by U.S. Sens. Rob Portman (R-OH), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), John Barrasso (R-WY), Thad Cochran (R-MS), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Mark Kirk (R-IL), and David Perdue (R-GA) would:\u00a0     Give states with a failing Obamacare exchange the authority to allow residents to use their Obamacare subsidy to purchase any health plan of their choice, even those off the exchange, for the 2017 plan year.     If the state chooses to use this authority to allow residents to use subsidies outside of the exchange, the legislation will waive the Obamacare law's requirement that you must buy a specific health care plan or pay a fine of as much as $2,000 for a family of four next year.

Legislation Allowing States to Offer Americans More Health Insurance Options Next Year"}, "5": {"text": "Come November, the grim trudge across the increasingly barren Obamacare landscape begins anew. Consumers likely face staggering price hikes for individual insurance policies. Some types of plans could cost an average of 43 percent to 55 percent more.\u00a0Many consumers will find fewer choices because major carriers have fled markets. Those insurers fled because they didn t want to lose more money on a government-run market that is so far out of whack   a market they think likely will never be profitable for them.Let s look at the failings and how they can drive solutions:Obamacare failed primarily because it flunked Economics 101 and Human Nature 101. It straitjacketed insurers into providing overly expensive, soup-to-nuts policies. It wasn t flexible enough so that people could buy as much coverage as they wanted and could afford   not what the government dictated.Obamacare failed because the penalties for going uncovered are too low when stacked against its skyrocketing premium costs. Financial incentive: Skip Obamacare.Obamacare failed because insurance is based on risk pools   that is, the lucky subsidize the unlucky. The unlucky who have big health problems reap much greater benefits than those who remain healthy and out of the doctors  office. But Obamacare s rules hamstring insurers. They can t exclude people for pre-existing conditions, and can t charge older customers more than three times as much as the young. Those are good goals, but they skew the market in ways Obamacare didn t figure out how to offset.Obamacare failed because it allowed Americans to sign up after they got sick and needed help paying all those medical bills. If you can game the system and, for example, buy auto coverage after you crash into your garage, then you have no incentive to buy insurance beforehand.Obamacare failed because it hasn t tamed U.S. medical costs.Obamacare failed because too many carriers simply can t cover expenses, let alone turn a profit, in this rigidly controlled system. Take Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, the state s dominant Obamacare insurer. Last year, for every dollar the carrier collected, it spent $1.32 buying care and providing services for customers.What s clear is that the solutions to Obamacare are implicit in its failures. A repaired or replaced system has to be more flexible, letting insurers offer a wider range of plans so that consumers, not lawmakers or bureaucrats, dictate what s best for them. That system should protect those who carry continuous coverage, not coddle those who duck in and out of plans when their health needs change.A new system also should scrap the job-killing Obamacare mandates that discourage companies from hiring and discourage workers from adding hours. Instead of gearing subsidies to incomes, let Americans not covered via an employer reap tax credits to help finance their insurance purchases on the open market. And tell us again: Why can t insurers sell policies across state lines?

Pinal County, Arizona recently became the first county in America to be left without a single provider in the Obamacare marketplace. Nearly all of Arizona's counties currently have just one health care provider offering health care plans in the exchanges. Last week, Maricopa County, Arizona - the most populous county in the state - became the latest to be left with only one provider in the Obamacare exchanges after Phoenix Health Plans, Inc. announced it would leave the exchanges. This trend is true across the country. According to Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurance company offering health care plans in the Obamacare marketplace.\u00a0 \"With Phoenix Health Plans, Inc.'s exit from the Obamacare marketplace last week, nearly all of Arizona's counties are now left with either one or no options when it comes to health insurance under Obamacare,\" said Senator McCain. \"This legislation would ensure that Arizonans are not forced to pay a penalty due to the failure of a healthcare system that was fatally flawed from conception. This failed law will only continue to place undue burdens on Arizona families unless we replace it with solutions that put patients back in charge of their health care.\"\u00a0 \"Obamacare is an unmitigated disaster in Arizona,\" said Senator Flake. \"The exchanges for 13 of the state's 15 counties are devoid of competition because they are left with only a single insurer willing to sell coverage. Another county's exchange has the dubious distinction of being the first in the nation to be completely abandoned by providers. As the administration continues to defend this failed law, we will not wait around for them to fix its mess, which is why we have introduced this legislation to help protect those in Arizona and across the country from unjustifiable financial penalties when they are left without healthcare options.\"\u00a0 \"Instead of lowering costs, Obamacare has made things worse: insurance companies across the country are fleeing the exchange market at an alarming rate, premiums have skyrocketed, and networks have become more narrow. Obamacare is in a death spiral. What's worse, Obamacare will impose a fine on countless individuals who no longer have affordable insurance options in their county,\" said Senator Cotton. \"Hard-working Americans shouldn't face more taxes because President Obama's Obamacare hopes and dreams failed. This bill will provide much needed relief from the Obamacare Mandate penalty and allow Americans to purchase coverage they can afford and that actually meets their healthcare needs.\u00a0 \"As Obamacare continues to crumble, here's the administration's cruel choice for millions of Americans next year: pay Washington's mandate or bite the bullet and pay the only insurance company available on the exchange in your county,\" said Senator Sasse. \"Our simple legislation spares moms and dads from Obamacare's raw deal. For months we've sounded the alarm about Obamacare's lousy choices and unaffordable prices--this whole mess must be repealed but, if Democrats keep trying to defend the indefensible, we should at least help those who are hurt the most.\"\u00a0 \"The definition of 'marketplace' is an economic system in which companies compete with each other to sell their products. It leads to lower prices, higher quality, and a higher level of customer service,\" said Senator Johnson. \"The Obamacare definition of marketplace, by contrast, has resulted in a failed government system that reduces competition and its benefits. Under Obamacare, Wisconsinites can be penalized for not buying a company's product, even when there is only one company selling it. This legislation would help ensure that Wisconsin families won't have to pay a penalty to help cover the cost of Obamacare's failed promise of consumer choice.\"\u00a0 \"A majority of Americans have two or fewer options on the Obamacare exchanges, and 31 percent have only one option,\" said Senator Barrasso. \"When there's only one option, that's not a marketplace, it's a monopoly. This bill provides desperately needed relief for those who are hit the hardest.\"\u00a0 Last week, Senator McCain sent a letter asking the Obama Administration how it planned to address the coverage gap that citizens of Pinal County may experience next year as a result of Aetna's recent decision to pull out of the Obamacare marketplace.\u00a0 Senator McCain has also introduced legislation that would fully repeal and replace Obamacare with affordable and accessible solutions that put patients back in charge of their health care decisions.

In explaining the need for Obamacare, he said this:\u00a0\u00a0 \"[W]hat's happening to your premiums? What's happening to your co-payments? What's happening to your deductible? They're all going up. That's money straight out of your pocket.\"\u00a0 \"So,\" he said, \"the bottom line is this: The status quo on health care is simply unsustainable.\"\u00a0 Simply unsustainable.\u00a0 That was the President's view on the state of our health care system before Obamacare. Here's his view on our health care system six years later.\u00a0 \"Too many Americans still strain to pay for their physician visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles, or pay their monthly insurance bills; struggle to navigate a complex, sometimes bewildering system; and remain uninsured.\"\u00a0 The President wrote that just last month. It sounds an awful lot like what we heard from him years ago, in a pre-Obamacare world.\u00a0 It throws the reality of his partisan law into stark relief. It's not only that Obamacare is failing to live up to the many promises invoked to sell it, it's often making things worse.\u00a0 Just pick up any paper or turn on the news and you'll see that more troubling projections are rolling in when it comes to Obamacare.\u00a0 In fact, each day seems to bring more forecasts of skyrocketing premiums and dwindling choices. It's a trend hitting Americans across the country. For instance, here's the headline people in my home state recently awoke to: \"Get ready to pay more for health insurance in Kentucky.\" The story goes on to warn of Obamacare premium rates that could skyrocket by as high as 47 percent. Nearly 160,000 people are expected to be impacted.\u00a0 Here's a letter from a Louisville man who recently contacted my office. \"How,\" he asked, \"are working class Americans, like myself, able to budget for such drastic changes?\" \"The so-called Affordable Care Act,\" he said, \"is unaffordable.\"\u00a0 He and other Kentuckians are hardly alone in feeling this way. Take Illinois, where premiums could soar by as much as 55 percent&hellip; Or Tennessee and Montana, where some rates could skyrocket by more than 60 percent&hellip;\u00a0 Or Minnesota, where premiums could rise by an average of more than 50 percent&hellip;\u00a0 Minnesota's Democratic Governor said he was \"alarmed\" by these \"drastic increases,\" and called them \"reason for very serious concerns.\"\u00a0 Even my friend the Democratic Leader referred to Obamacare's premium increases yesterday as, quote, \"huge.\" He's right.\u00a0 He was right to mention Obamacare's \"tax increases\" too. This partisan law raised taxes that hit the Middle Class after Democrats promised it wouldn't.\u00a0 So these \"huge\" premium increases aren't the only reason Obamacare is raising costs for the Middle Class. Premiums aren't the only reason that Americans recently cited health costs as their number one financial concern.\u00a0 It isn't hard to see why Americans might be hurting. Taxes are up. Co-pays are up.\u00a0 Deductibles are outpacing wages.\u00a0 And now, with more and more insurance companies pulling out of the Obamacare state exchanges, Americans are being left with another big problem: fewer coverage options.\u00a0 The Obama Administration used to promise us that the Obamacare marketplace would \"provide more choice and control over health insurance options\" and result in \"a significant increase in competition and an array of options for consumers everywhere.\"\u00a0 But that's not the reality for many Americans today.\u00a0\u00a0Obamacare has forced out so many insurers that about one in five Obamacare customers will be forced to find a new insurance company this fall. More than half of the country could have two or fewer insurers to choose from in the exchanges next year, and about a third of all counties in the U.S. -- along with seven entire states -- are set to have just a single insurer offering plans in their area. That includes one county in Arizona that, until just last night, would have had no options in the exchange at all. I know this is something that Senator McCain has been deeply concerned about and he's introduced good legislation to address it.\u00a0\u00a0Obamacare co-ops continue to collapse at every turn too, with less than a third expected to offer plans next year. When these co-ops collapse, they can cost taxpayers millions and disrupt coverage for thousands of enrollees. They can force patients to start over on their deductibles mid-year, even find new doctors.\u00a0 These are the latest reverberating echoes of the president's most famous broken promise \"if you like your health care plan you can keep it.\"\u00a0 Here's a Kentuckian from Campbellsburg, who wrote to me after losing his insurance.\u00a0 \"I lost my health insurance that I had for many years because of Obamacare. Instead of something affordable, I face the possibility of struggling to purchase an Obama health plan that costs two to three times what I had been paying.\" To top it off, he said, the \"process of trying to find coverage has been a nightmare.\"\u00a0 And here's something to keep in mind when Democrats try to spin the American people on Obamacare. For all of this chaos and pain for Middle Class families, Obamacare still has not even achieved its stated purpose of universal coverage. Not even close. Tens of millions still remain uninsured.\u00a0 And those who do have insurance are now discovering that simply having health insurance isn't the same thing as having health coverage.\u00a0 Take one New Jersey man who's suffered for years from chronic migraines and needs medication to help alleviate the pain. The moment Obamacare placed him on Medicaid, he lost access to each of his doctors which meant waiting four months to see a new doctor and get a prescription to the medication he needs.\u00a0 \"You have a card saying you have health insurance,\" he said, \"but if no doctors take it, it's almost like having one of those fake IDs. Your medication is all paid for, but if you can't get the pills, it's worthless.\" *** According to a Gallup poll released just this morning, many more Americans report that Obamacare has hurt rather than helped their families--and many more Americans say that Obamacare will make their family's health situation worse rather than better over the long run. Is it any wonder?\u00a0 Americans were told that Obamacare would allow them to keep the health plans they liked.\u00a0 They couldn't.\u00a0 Americans were told that Obamacare would drive down health care premiums by $2,500 per family.\u00a0 It hasn't.\u00a0 Americans were told that Obamacare would not raise taxes on the Middle Class.\u00a0 It did.\u00a0 Americans were told that Obamacare would increase choice and competition. The opposite is proving true.\u00a0 And remember the promise \"if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor\"? It's been broken too. In fact, the Obama Administration recently erased references to \"keeping your doctor\" from its website.\u00a0 These predictable consequences are not just flukes or quirks of Obamacare. They are not just small wrinkles in the system that will work themselves out with time. They represent fundamental flaws built into this law's original design. Republicans warned about Obamacare's consequences repeatedly from the start.\u00a0 Democrats mocked us for doing so, and rammed through their partisan law anyway.\u00a0 I invite Democrats to now consider following the lead of one of the president's own former health care advisers, who recently penned an op-ed titled \"How I was wrong about ObamaCare.\"\u00a0 The problems Democrats caused for the Middle Class aren't going away until Obamacare does. So if Democrats are serious about helping the Middle Class, they'll work with us to build a bridge beyond Obamacare to better care. Anything else is just more hollow rhetoric. Today, six years on, Obamacare is failing the Middle Class -- but the president still hasn't offered a serious solution to fix it.\u00a0 He's now trying to convince Americans that the solution to his bloated, unwieldy, and expensive law is to make it more bloated, more unwieldly, and more expensive. In other words, more of the same -- just worse.\u00a0 His preferred presidential candidate says the same thing. So do congressional Democrats.\u00a0 How can anyone conclude, after reading all these stories about how Obamacare is hurting the Middle Class, that what we need now is more Obamacare in the form of a government-run plan?\u00a0 Look.\u00a0 Democrats can continue to spin us on how great this law is. They can continue to tell Americans to \"get over\" this law and its pain for the Middle Class. They can continue to laugh at Americans who lose their plans. They can continue to crow about exploiting, quote, the \"stupidity of the American voter\" to push this partisan law on the Middle Class.\u00a0 Or they can work with us to move beyond the failed experiment of Obamacare. They can prove that they are finally willing to put people before ideology. Because this much is clear.\u00a0Obamacare is a direct attack on the Middle Class.\u00a0 It hurts the very people it was supposedly designed to help.\u00a0 It raises costs, crushes choice, and is now crashing down all around us.\u00a0 It simply isn't working.\u00a0 To quote what President Obama said six years ago, \"the bottom line is this: The status quo on health care is simply unsustainable.\"  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com ", "byline": "", "date": "September 10, 2016 Saturday", "title": "Washington: McConnell: Obamacare is failing the Middle Class"}, "36": {"text": "Health Reform: Rates for ObamaCare will skyrocket next year, according to its former chief. Enrollment is tumbling this year. And a big insurer is quitting most exchanges. That's what we learned in just the past few days.\u00a0Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, revealed that she expects ObamaCare premium hikes \"to be higher than we saw previous years,\" including last year, which saw double-digit rate increases across the country.Tavenner was head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services until early 2015, so she helped bring ObamaCare to life. In November 2014, she boasted how \"the Affordable Care Act is working to improve competition and choice among marketplace plans.\"Now that she's jumped to the other side of the fence, she's discovered the dark side of the health reform monster she helped unleash.Why will 2017 rates spike even higher? In addition to the cost of complying with ObamaCare's insurance regulations and mandates, the ObamaCare exchanges have failed to attract enough young and healthy people needed to keep premiums down. Plus, two industry bailout programs expire this year, Tavenner notes.Oh, and she admits people game ObamaCare just like critics said they would: buying coverage after they get sick -- since insurance companies can no longer turn them down or charge more -- then dropping it when they're done with treatments. \"That churn increases premiums. So you have to kind of price over that.\"The timing of these coming rate shocks couldn't be worse for ObamaCare supporters, since insurers will start announcing premium increases just as the presidential election heats up. Insurers have already requested 18% rate increases in Virginia.Meanwhile, IBD's Jed Graham reported on Friday that ObamaCare enrollment has already dropped an average of more than 14% in five states since February -- a faster rate of decline than last year -- as people get kicked off for not paying premiums.Finally, we learned Tuesday UnitedHealth Group plans to drop out of almost every ObamaCare market it's now in after losing $1 billion on those policies.The result will be less competition in those states. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis found \"more than one in four counties where UnitedHealth participates nationally would see a drop from two insurers to one if the company exits and isn't replaced by a new entrant.\"Skyrocketing premiums, fewer choices in the marketplace, and people fleeing ObamaCare in droves after signing up. Not exactly what Obama promised.Democrats running for re-election this year might want to think twice about wrapping their arms around this terminally ill law. And Republicans should be busy crafting a replacement.", "clean_text2": "health reform rate obamacar skyrocket next year accord former chief enrol tumbl year big insur quit exchang learn past day marilyn tavenn ceo america health insur plan reveal expect obamacar premium hike higher saw previous year includ last year saw doubl digit rate increas across countri tavenn head center medicar medicaid servic earli 2015 help bring obamacar life novemb 2014 boast afford care act work improv competit choic among marketplac plan jump side fenc discov dark side health reform monster help unleash 2017 rate spike even higher addit cost compli obamacar insur regul mandat obamacar exchang fail attract enough young healthi peopl need keep premium plus two industri bailout program expir year tavenn note oh admit peopl game obamacar like critic said would buy coverag get sick sinc insur compani longer turn charg drop done treatment churn increas premium kind price time come rate shock wors obamacar support sinc insur start announc premium increas presidenti elect heat insur alreadi request 18 rate increas virginia meanwhil ibd jed graham report friday obamacar enrol alreadi drop averag 14 five state sinc februari faster rate declin last year peopl get kick pay premium final learn tuesday unitedhealth group plan drop almost everi obamacar market lose 1 billion polici result less competit state kaiser famili foundat analysi found one four counti unitedhealth particip nation would see drop two insur one compani exit replac new entrant skyrocket premium fewer choic marketplac peopl flee obamacar drove sign exact obama promis democrat run elect year might want think twice wrap arm around termin ill law republican busi craft replac", "byline": "", "date": "April 25, 2016 Monday", "clean_text": "health reform rate obamacar skyrocket next year accord former chief enrol tumbl year big insur quit exchang learn past day marilyn tavenn ceo america health insur plan reveal expect obamacar premium hike higher saw previous year includ last year saw doubl digit rate increas across countri tavenn head center medicar medicaid servic earli 2015 help bring obamacar life novemb 2014 boast afford care act work improv competit choic among marketplac plan jump side fenc discov dark side health reform monster help unleash 2017 rate spike even higher addit cost compli obamacar insur regul mandat obamacar exchang fail attract enough young healthi peopl need keep premium plus two industri bailout program expir year tavenn note oh admit peopl game obamacar like critic said would buy coverag get sick sinc insur compani longer turn charg drop done treatment churn increas premium kind price time come rate shock wors obamacar support sinc insur start announc premium increas presidenti elect heat insur alreadi request 18 rate increas virginia meanwhil ibd jed graham report friday obamacar enrol alreadi drop averag 14 five state sinc februari faster rate declin last year peopl get kick pay premium final learn tuesday unitedhealth group plan drop almost everi obamacar market lose 1 billion polici result less competit state kaiser famili foundat analysi found one four counti unitedhealth particip nation would see drop two insur one compani exit replac new entrant skyrocket premium fewer choic marketplac peopl flee obamacar drove sign exact obama promis democrat run elect year might want think twice wrap arm around termin ill law republican busi craft replac", "title": "ObamaCare's World Of Woes"}, "1": {"text": " Washington, DC: U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means has issued the following press release:  Earlier this month, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \"took out the trash,\" making a major (and majorly disappointing) Obamacare announcement on a Friday afternoon to avoid as many headlines as possible.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the latest Obamacare enrollment data, HHS failed to meet its own goals again:\u00a0 Letdown #1: Number of people to purchase health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges by the end of 2015\u00a0 Expectation*: 13 million active, premium-paying people will be enrolled through the Obamacare exchanges by the end of 2015.\u00a0 *Revised Expectation (due to high attrition rates): 9.1 million active, premium-paying people will be enrolled through the Obamacare exchanges by the end of 2015.\u00a0 Today's Reality: 8.78 million active, premium-paying people were enrolled through the Obamacare exchanges as of the end of 2015.\u00a0 &mdash;\u00a0 Letdown #2: Number of people to purchase health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges by the end of 2016\u00a0 Expectation: When the law passed, government and outside research organizations predicted between 21 and 27 million active, premium-paying people will enroll through the Obamacare exchanges by the end of 2016.\u00a0 Today's Reality: 10 million active, premium-paying people &mdash; less than half of what the CBO projected in 2010 &mdash; will enroll through the Obamacare exchanges by the end of 2016.\u00a0 &mdash;\u00a0 Letdown #3: Proportion of younger, healthier people enrolled through the Obamacare exchanges\u00a0 Expectation: Individual mandate will encourage younger, healthier Americans to purchase health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges, offsetting the cost of enrollees who are more expensive to insure.\u00a0 Today's Reality: More younger, healthier Americans are opting to pay a tax penalty rather than pay Obamacare's high premiums and even higher deductibles. This drives up the overall cost of Obamacare for everyone because the majority of the enrollees are more expensive to insure.\u00a0 &mdash;\u00a0 Why are the real numbers so much lower than the Administration expected? Because Obamacare health plans are just not worth the high cost.

This failed law will only continue to place undue burdens on Arizona families unless we replace it with solutions that put patients back in charge of their health care.\"\u00a0 \"Obamacare is an unmitigated disaster in Arizona,\" said Senator Flake. \"The exchanges for 13 of the state's 15 counties are devoid of competition because they are left with only a single insurer willing to sell coverage. Another county's exchange has the dubious distinction of being the first in the nation to be completely abandoned by providers. As the administration continues to defend this failed law, we will not wait around for them to fix its mess, which is why we have introduced this legislation to help protect those in Arizona and across the country from unjustifiable financial penalties when they are left without healthcare options.\"\u00a0 \"Instead of lowering costs, Obamacare has made things worse: insurance companies across the country are fleeing the exchange market at an alarming rate, premiums have skyrocketed, and networks have become more narrow. Obamacare is in a death spiral. What's worse, Obamacare will impose a fine on countless individuals who no longer have affordable insurance options in their county,\" said Senator Cotton. \"Hard-working Americans shouldn't face more taxes because President Obama's Obamacare hopes and dreams failed. This bill will provide much needed relief from the Obamacare Mandate penalty and allow Americans to purchase coverage they can afford and that actually meets their healthcare needs.\u00a0 \"As Obamacare continues to crumble, here's the administration's cruel choice for millions of Americans next year: pay Washington's mandate or bite the bullet and pay the only insurance company available on the exchange in your county,\" said Senator Sasse. \"Our simple legislation spares moms and dads from Obamacare's raw deal. For months we've sounded the alarm about Obamacare's lousy choices and unaffordable prices--this whole mess must be repealed but, if Democrats keep trying to defend the indefensible, we should at least help those who are hurt the most.\"\u00a0 \"The definition of 'marketplace' is an economic system in which companies compete with each other to sell their products. It leads to lower prices, higher quality, and a higher level of customer service,\" said Senator Johnson. \"The Obamacare definition of marketplace, by contrast, has resulted in a failed government system that reduces competition and its benefits. Under Obamacare, Wisconsinites can be penalized for not buying a company's product, even when there is only one company selling it. This legislation would help ensure that Wisconsin families won't have to pay a penalty to help cover the cost of Obamacare's failed promise of consumer choice.\"\u00a0 \"A majority of Americans have two or fewer options on the Obamacare exchanges, and 31 percent have only one option,\" said Senator Barrasso. \"When there's only one option, that's not a marketplace, it's a monopoly.

{"text": "While it may be politically inconvenient now that he's decided to seek higher office, the fact is that Wayne Stenehjem indisputably supported Obamacare.King v. Burwell was heard by the Supreme Court in 2015 and was widely considered to be conservatives' last chance to overturn Obamacare. At issue was whether or not the legislation authorized the federal government to apply federal income tax subsidies to individuals residing in states that had not established healthcare exchanges. While the text of the legislation provided little basis for such authorization, this interpretation would have rendered Obamacare unworkable. If this provision were overturned, it would likely mean the end of Obamacare.\u00a0Conservatives rallied. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan put aside personal differences to sign an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to rule against the Obama administration.Across the aisle, liberals banded together to defend Barack Obama's takeover of our healthcare system. Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid led other congressional liberals in submitting a brief that defended Obamacare. Another group of liberals - 21 Democrat attorneys general from across the country - submitted their own brief; joining them as the lone Republican was North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem.These liberals succeeded in persuading the Supreme Court to rewrite the law and save Obamacare. It was an interpretation that the late-Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia famously described as, \"not merely unnatural; it is unheard of.\" It was exactly the interpretation that Stenehjem and his liberal colleagues had pleaded with the court to take.While Stenehjem continues to deny that he \"supported\" Obamacare, his actions in the King v. Burwell case clearly demonstrate that he did. Why did he decide that Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan were wrong, but Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and Barack Obama were right?", "clean_text2": "may polit inconveni decid seek higher offic fact wayn stenehjem indisput support obamacar king v burwel heard suprem court 2015 wide consid conserv last chanc overturn obamacar issu whether legisl author feder govern appli feder incom tax subsidi individu resid state establish healthcar exchang text legisl provid littl basi author interpret would render obamacar unwork provis overturn would like mean end obamacar conserv ralli ted cruz marco rubio paul ryan put asid person differ sign amicus brief urg suprem court rule obama administr across aisl liber band togeth defend barack obama takeov healthcar system nanci pelosi harri reid led congression liber submit brief defend obamacar anoth group liber 21 democrat attorney general across countri submit brief join lone republican north dakota attorney general wayn stenehjem liber succeed persuad suprem court rewrit law save obamacar interpret late suprem court justic antonin scalia famous describ mere unnatur unheard exact interpret stenehjem liber colleagu plead court take stenehjem continu deni support obamacar action king v burwel case clear demonstr decid ted cruz marco rubio paul ryan wrong nanci pelosi harri reid barack obama right", "byline": "", "date": "April 27, 2016 Wednesday", "clean_text": "may polit inconveni decid seek higher offic fact wayn stenehjem indisput support obamacar king v burwel heard suprem court 2015 wide consid conserv last chanc overturn obamacar issu whether legisl author feder govern appli feder incom tax subsidi individu resid state establish healthcar exchang text legisl provid littl basi author interpret would render obamacar unwork provis overturn would like mean end obamacar conserv ralli ted cruz marco rubio paul ryan put asid person differ sign amicus brief urg suprem court rule obama administr across aisl liber band togeth defend barack obama takeov healthcar system nanci pelosi harri reid led congression liber submit brief defend obamacar anoth group liber 21 democrat attorney general across countri submit brief join lone republican north dakota attorney general wayn stenehjem liber succeed persuad suprem court rewrit law save obamacar interpret late suprem court justic antonin scalia famous describ mere unnatur unheard exact interpret stenehjem liber colleagu plead court take stenehjem continu deni support obamacar action king v burwel case clear demonstr decid ted cruz marco rubio paul ryan wrong nanci pelosi harri reid barack obama right", "title": "Stenehjem indisputablysupported Obamacare"}, "22": {"text": " Washington: Office of the Senator Ben Sasse has issued the following news release:   Today U.S. Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE), a member of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that investigated the Affordable Care Act's CO-OP program earlier this year, announced his companion legislation to Nebraska Congressman Adrian Smith's CO-OP Consumer Protection Act. The simple legislation would repeal Obamacare's mandate for families who lost their insurance coverage when Obamacare's CO-OPs collapsed.\u00a0\u00a0 \"This is about fairness. It is unjust to make families who suffered because of the incompetence of Obamacare's bureaucrats pay Obamacare's mandate. More than a hundred thousand Nebraskans and Iowans lost their health insurance when CoOportunity failed and that was just the beginning -- more than half of Obamacare's CO-OPs have collapsed across the country. While the entirety of Obamacare must be repealed, Republicans and Democrats should be able to at least agree that it is callous to force CO-OP victims to pay Obamacare's individual mandate penalty. I'm grateful for Congressman Smith's work in the House and I'm proud to join that effort by introducing this bill in the Senate.\"\u00a0 Background:\u00a0 Sasse will introduce the Senate companion to the CO-OP Consumer Protection Act early next week. This legislation repeals Obamacare's individual mandate for anyone who purchased insurance from one Obamacare's failed CO-OPs. The bill applies retroactively to the Nebraskans and Iowans who lost their coverage when CoOportunity failed.

Enrollment is tumbling this year. And a big insurer is quitting most exchanges. That's what we learned in just the past few days.\u00a0Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, revealed that she expects ObamaCare premium hikes \"to be higher than we saw previous years,\" including last year, which saw double-digit rate increases across the country.Tavenner was head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services until early 2015, so she helped bring ObamaCare to life. In November 2014, she boasted how \"the Affordable Care Act is working to improve competition and choice among marketplace plans.\"Now that she's jumped to the other side of the fence, she's discovered the dark side of the health reform monster she helped unleash.Why will 2017 rates spike even higher? In addition to the cost of complying with ObamaCare's insurance regulations and mandates, the ObamaCare exchanges have failed to attract enough young and healthy people needed to keep premiums down. Plus, two industry bailout programs expire this year, Tavenner notes.Oh, and she admits people game ObamaCare just like critics said they would: buying coverage after they get sick -- since insurance companies can no longer turn them down or charge more -- then dropping it when they're done with treatments. \"That churn increases premiums. So you have to kind of price over that.\"The timing of these coming rate shocks couldn't be worse for ObamaCare supporters, since insurers will start announcing premium increases just as the presidential election heats up. Insurers have already requested 18% rate increases in Virginia.Meanwhile, IBD's Jed Graham reported on Friday that ObamaCare enrollment has already dropped an average of more than 14% in five states since February -- a faster rate of decline than last year -- as people get kicked off for not paying premiums.Finally, we learned Tuesday UnitedHealth Group plans to drop out of almost every ObamaCare market it's now in after losing $1 billion on those policies.The result will be less competition in those states. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis found \"more than one in four counties where UnitedHealth participates nationally would see a drop from two insurers to one if the company exits and isn't replaced by a new entrant.\"Skyrocketing premiums, fewer choices in the marketplace, and people fleeing ObamaCare in droves after signing up. Not exactly what Obama promised.Democrats running for re-election this year might want to think twice about wrapping their arms around this terminally ill law.

And you've probably read in the news that rates may be 60 percent higher next year than they were this year for the same insurance policy. And come November, nearly a third of the nation's counties will have only one insurer for you to choose from when you have to buy health insurance on the regional Obamacare exchange as the market collapses and insurance companies are leaving the Obamacare exchanges in droves. This legislation would allow your state to give you the option of buying health insurance wherever you can find it whether on or off the Obamacare exchange.\"\u00a0 \"This one-year solution is not a substitute for the long-term need to repeal and replace Obamacare with step-by-step reforms that transform the health care delivery system by putting patients in charge, giving them more choices and reducing the cost of health care so that more people can afford it,\" he continued. \"That would require a Republican president next year, but it gives Americans a real solution for next year and lets them know that we are on their side. Even if we have a Democratic president next year, we cannot continue without making big, structural changes soon to avoid a collapse of our nation's health insurance market.\"\u00a0 Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) said: \"More than 11,000 people in my home state recently learned that they would have to find a new health care plan after an insurer announced that it would be leaving the New Hampshire partnership exchange next year. Higher premiums and fewer choices are impacting real people today, and hardworking Granite Staters can't afford to keep taking these hits. Our legislation would provide a temporary means to lessen the burdens of ObamaCare on New Hampshire families and individuals by allowing eligible individuals to use a subsidy to purchase health insurance outside of the exchanges, which may offer less expensive options than plans available through the exchanges.  This bill will help bring back some much-needed flexibility and choice in the health insurance marketplace, both of which ObamaCare has limited.\"\u00a0 Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said: \"In more than half of all counties in America, there will be only be two or fewer carriers offering coverage on the Obamacare exchange. Hard-working families facing higher premiums because of Obamacare deserve relief.  This legislation will give families more choices in 2017, as Republicans work to replace this failed law with real reforms that will make health care more affordable for all Americans.\"\u00a0 Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said: \"Time has shown that Obamacare is resulting in fewer and more expensive choices for the American people.  This legislation would increase options for families in Mississippi and elsewhere to obtain health insurance without being locked into troubled Obamacare exchanges,\"\u00a0 Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) said: \"I have worked for years to limit the damage and harm done to real people by Obamacare, a partisan policy that promised marketplace competition and higher quality health plans at lower costs and instead delivered the exact opposite. This bill would provide necessary relief to Wisconsinites who, under Obamacare, would be penalized for not purchasing a product that they cannot afford or does not meet their needs. It will allow the state to provide Wisconsinites receiving subsidies more options than just those offered on the Obamacare exchanges for 2017.\"\u00a0 Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said: \"Ohioans need immediate relief from the skyrocketing cost of Obamacare. Premiums have increased in Ohio more than 90% since the President's health care law went into place. This bill would provide individuals who have suffered under the high costs and fewer choices of Obamacare more options to receive coverage--which means more competition which in turn brings down costs. After eight years of stagnating wages, slow economic growth, and a rising cost of living, Ohioans deserve the relief this legislation would provide, not a health care system they can't afford.\"                                                             \u00a0 The legislation, introduced by U.S. Sens.

If the state chooses to use this authority to allow residents to use subsidies outside of the exchange, the legislation will waive the Obamacare law's requirement that you must buy a specific health care plan or pay a fine of as much as $2,000 for a family of four next year.

has issued the following news release:  Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) today voted to save millions of middle class families and seniors from an Obamacare tax hike, relieving them of shouldering the financial burden of the unworkable and unsustainable health care law.\u00a0\u00a0 \"This is another example of just how bad this law is,\" Hartzler said. \"Instead of making health care more affordable and accessible, Obamacare has been raising costs and hiking taxes. To pay for this bad law, Obamacare has penalized middle class families for having high health care costs and has now set its sights on seniors.\"\u00a0\u00a0Obamacare's tax increases hit seniors and middle class families hardest. Prior to passage of Obamacare, Americans could deduct out of pocket medical expenses that exceeded 7.5 percent of their adjusted annual income.  In 2012, 10.2 million families - more than half of which brought in less than $50,000 annually - used this tax provision.\u00a0 After the implementation of Obamacare, this threshold increased to 10 percent for most families, meaning they can deduct less and their tax bill increases. On January 1, 2017 it will also increase for seniors unless it is stopped.\u00a0 \"Americans are looking for relief from high health care costs,\" Hartzler continued. \"Raising their taxes even further is no answer. This bill brings the relief they are searching for by allowing those families who need it most to deduct more of their health care costs from their taxes. Charging people more, especially those who are most vulnerable, is no way to make health care affordable. It is just wrong.\"\u00a0 According to The National Center for Policy Analysis, the average senior spends $4,888 a year on medical expenses, twice as much as the average non-elderly adult. The Joint Tax Committee, a nonpartisan committee of the United States Congress, says the funds raised by this tax increase will have an enormous impact on the budgets of American families who would save on average $200 to $400 a year if this were to become law.\u00a0 Congresswoman Hartzler represents Missouri's Fourth Congressional district in the U.S. House of representatives. She serves on the House Armed Services, Agriculture, and Budget Committees.

Premiums have increased in Ohio more than 90 percent since the president's health care law went into place. This bill would provide individuals who have suffered under the high costs and fewer choices of Obamacare more options to receive coverage--which means more competition which in turn brings down costs. After eight years of stagnating wages, slow economic growth, and a rising cost of living, Ohioans deserve the relief this legislation would provide, not a health care system they can't afford.\"\u00a0 Senate health committee chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN) said: \"If you aren't on Medicare or Medicaid and don't obtain your health insurance through your employer, you are probably one of the nearly 11 million Americans who purchase their insurance on their own through the Obamacare exchange in your state. And you've probably read in the news that rates may be 60 percent higher next year than they were this year for the same insurance policy. And come November, nearly a third of the nation's counties will have only one insurer for you to choose from when you have to buy health insurance on the regional Obamacare exchange as the market collapses and insurance companies are leaving the Obamacare exchanges in droves. This legislation would allow your state to give you the option of buying health insurance wherever you can find it whether on or off the Obamacare exchange.\"\u00a0 \"This one-year solution is not a substitute for the long-term need to repeal and replace Obamacare with step-by-step reforms that transform the health care delivery system by putting patients in charge, giving them more choices and reducing the cost of health care so that more people can afford it,\" he continued. \"That would require a Republican president next year, but it gives Americans a real solution for next year and lets them know that we are on their side. Even if we have a Democratic president next year, we cannot continue without making big, structural changes soon to avoid a collapse of our nation's health insurance market.\"\u00a0 Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) said: \"More than 11,000 people in my home state recently learned that they would have to find a new health care plan after an insurer announced that it would be leaving the New Hampshire partnership exchange next year. Higher premiums and fewer choices are impacting real people today, and hardworking Granite Staters can't afford to keep taking these hits. Our legislation would provide a temporary means to lessen the burdens of ObamaCare on New Hampshire families and individuals by allowing eligible individuals to use a subsidy to purchase health insurance outside of the exchanges, which may offer less expensive options than plans available through the exchanges.  This bill will help bring back some much-needed flexibility and choice in the health insurance marketplace, both of which ObamaCare has limited.\"\u00a0 Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) said: \"In more than half of all counties in America, there will be only be two or fewer carriers offering coverage on the Obamacare exchange. Hard-working families facing higher premiums because of Obamacare deserve relief.  This legislation will give families more choices in 2017, as Republicans work to replace this failed law with real reforms that will make health care more affordable for all Americans.\"\u00a0 Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) said: \"Time has shown that Obamacare is resulting in fewer and more expensive choices for the American people.  This legislation would increase options for families in Mississippi and elsewhere to obtain health insurance without being locked into troubled Obamacare exchanges,\"\u00a0 Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) said: \"I have worked for years to limit the damage and harm done to real people by Obamacare, a partisan policy that promised marketplace competition and higher quality health plans at lower costs and instead delivered the exact opposite. This bill would provide necessary relief to Wisconsinites who, under Obamacare, would be penalized for not purchasing a product that they cannot afford or does not meet their needs. It will allow the state to provide Wisconsinites receiving subsidies more options than just those offered on the Obamacare exchanges for 2017.\"                                              \u00a0 The legislation, introduced by U.S. Sens.

If the state chooses to use this authority to allow residents to use subsidies outside of the exchange, the legislation will waive the Obamacare law's requirement that you must buy a specific health care plan or pay a fine of as much as $2,000 for a family of four next year.

Options Next Year"}, "28": {"text": " Washington: Office of the Senator Johnny Isakson has issued the following news release:  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today spoke on the floor of the Senate citing examples of how the president's signature health care plan has broken promises. He warned that unless this fatally flawed law is rolled back then Obamacare would soon become a government-run monopoly and Georgians and all Americans will continue to be without what they were promised: a choice of doctors and health plans, access to quality care, and accountability and transparency.\u00a0\u00a0 To help Georgians affected by higher premiums and reduced choice after insurers have recently been forced to leave the Obamacare exchange, Isakson today co-sponsored two pieces of legislation -- the Obamacare Tax Relief and Consumer Choice Act and the Protection from Obamacare Monopolies Act -- to free the hardworking families who are being hurt by Obamacare's failure from having to comply with the law's unfair mandates and taxes.\u00a0 \"Just last month after Aetna, United Healthcare and Cigna announced they would leave Georgia's marketplace, [and] Blue Cross [Blue Shield] filed its third premium increase for the third time this summer, an increase of 21.4 percent,\" explained Isakson. \"Earlier in the summer, Humana announced the average premium increase in the state of Georgia of a whopping 67.5 percent. And in 2016, all 159 counties in Georgia had at least two provider options. Next year, 96 counties in Georgia will only have one option.\u00a0 \"The numbers do not lie. We cannot rely on going to a government single-payer system. It will bankrupt the country, it will destroy health care and eliminate the choice we all loved as Americans. &hellip;I challenge the Senate to get down to business and do the right thing for the American people and for the people of Georgia that I represent.\"\u00a0 In August, a 21.4 percent rate increase was approved for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia. While Georgians were promised more choice and lower costs of healthcare as a result of Obamacare, the opposite is true. Now, in six out of every ten Georgia counties, the only option for health insurance coverage is Blue Cross Blue Shield, leaving citizens in rural areas without the choices for the coverage that they need.\u00a0 Isakson signed on to the Obamacare Tax Relief and Consumer Choice Act, which creates an exemption from the Obamacare mandate if the average cost for individual or family coverage for the second-lowest-cost silver plan has increased by more than 10 percent from the previous year. It also expands Obamacare's affordability exemption to account for the cost of deductibles and removes Obamacare's tax increases on health savings accounts and allows individuals to use these accounts for over-the-counter drugs.\u00a0 Isakson also co-sponsored the Protection from Obamacare Monopolies Act to allow residents to be exempted from the Obamacare mandate in counties where there is only one or no Affordable Care Act-compliant insurance issuer available, such as in the 96 counties in Georgia now left with only one option for health care insurers.

They say it has provided insurance coverage to millions of Americans and come in below cost.They are right to claim that many Americans have benefited from the law. But the benefits are overstated, and the law's harms look set to rise.The drop in the number of Americans without insurance is the biggest accomplishment. But that decline has not been as large as originally estimated. When the law passed, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that by the end of 2015 an additional 15 million people would be getting coverage through Medicaid and 13 million would be getting coverage through the exchanges. Now CBO says that 10 million additional people were on Medicaid, and the administration says that 8.8 million were on the exchanges, in 2015.\u00a0Still, those are real gains. The people covered now have a measure of financial security they had not previously enjoyed. Yet Medicaid coverage does not appear to be associated with significant improvements in recipients' physical health. And the benefits are low compared with the costs: A recent study found that every dollar spent on the program yielded 20 to 40 cents in benefits.Other people have seen their financial security reduced because of Obamacare. Deductibles in employer health plans have been rising fast, leaving many people with policies that ccc thanks to Obamacare regulations ccc cover routine medical expenses but leave them on the hook for thousands of dollars in a medical emergency. A sensible insurance policy would have the opposite priorities.Obama famously said that Obamacare would bring family premiums down by $2,500. That hasn't happened, of course: Average family premiums for employer coverage went to $17,545 in 2015 from $13,375 in 2009. The administration argues that the law has contributed to a slowdown in the growth of health spending. But that slowdown started in 2002. Obamacare can't be the cause. The best that can be said about the law's effect on health spending is that its early years haven't interrupted that slowdown.The Congressional Budget Office believes that the law is having a negative effect on employment. It projects that Americans next year will work the equivalent of 2 million fewer jobs because of the law. That's partly because the law's subsidies decline when people work more. The subsidies thus reduce the rewards to work and induce people to work less.More Americans dislike Obamacare than like it, which has been the case since before its passage. More think the law has hurt them than think it has helped them. And as flawed as the law already appears, worse days may be ahead for it.The law's health exchanges are showing signs of trouble. Enrollees are poorer and older than expected, which means the tax for being uninsured may not be succeeding in its aim of getting healthy people to sign up. If so, the exchanges could prove incapable of sustaining themselves.Obamacare was supposed to pay for itself, but several features of the law that were meant to bring in revenue have proven as politically unrealistic as critics said. Congress has already suspended the law's medical-device tax and its tax on high-end, employer-provided insurance plans in a bipartisan deal.Obamacare was a badly designed law. We could have achieved gains in insurance coverage without Obamacare's regulation-heavy approach; we could have addressed the health-care system's discrete problems without trying to overhaul it from Washington, D.C.Those without access to employer health plans could have been given enough money to buy a policy that protected them against catastrophic expenses ccc and that offered more protection if they put some of their own income into the policy. Modest regulatory changes could have been made to make it easier for people with pre-existing conditions to get coverage, too.Neither Republicans nor Democrats, for different reasons, were interested in going down that path when Obamacare was being debated. Now, belatedly, some Republicans are interested in moving the health system in this direction. The Democratic response to dissatisfaction with Obamacare, on the other hand, is likely to be to blame the law's failures on health-care providers and seek tighter regulations of them.One way or the other, though, Obamacare will probably have to be changed substantially under the next president ccc even if Democrats, amid their anniversary celebrations, are loath to admit it.- - -Ramesh Ponnuru,

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that investigated the Affordable Care Act's CO-OP program earlier this year, announced his companion legislation to Nebraska Congressman Adrian Smith's CO-OP Consumer Protection Act. The simple legislation would repeal Obamacare's mandate for families who lost their insurance coverage when Obamacare's CO-OPs collapsed.\u00a0\u00a0 \"This is about fairness. It is unjust to make families who suffered because of the incompetence of Obamacare's bureaucrats pay Obamacare's mandate. More than a hundred thousand Nebraskans and Iowans lost their health insurance when CoOportunity failed and that was just the beginning -- more than half of Obamacare's CO-OPs have collapsed across the country. While the entirety of Obamacare must be repealed, Republicans and Democrats should be able to at least agree that it is callous to force CO-OP victims to pay Obamacare's individual mandate penalty. I'm grateful for Congressman Smith's work in the House and I'm proud to join that effort by introducing this bill in the Senate.\"\u00a0 Background:\u00a0 Sasse will introduce the Senate companion to the CO-OP Consumer Protection Act early next week. This legislation repeals Obamacare's individual mandate for anyone who purchased insurance from one Obamacare's failed CO-OPs. The bill applies retroactively to the Nebraskans and Iowans who lost their coverage when CoOportunity failed.

Frank Guinta (NH-01).\u00a0\u00a0     Manchester's former mayor, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare - and succeeded in delaying a 40-percent tax on employee health benefits, which New Hampshire employers said would harm hiring and wages - voted for the legislation, the Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2015, yesterday.\u00a0    Specifically, it lifts Obamacare restrictions on purchasing over-the-counter prescriptions using a health savings account (HSA), increases HSA contribution limits, and expands allowable expenses. HSAs are tax-exempt saving accounts for medical purposes that supplement high-deductible health insurance plans.\u00a0     \"In order to pay for high deductibles under Obamacare, middle- and working-class Granite Staters are turning to HSAs out of necessity. To force participation in a bad healthcare plan, however, the Administration is denying people struggling to make ends meet a sensible alternative,\" said Rep. Guinta. \"We're helping to return some flexibility to their lives.\"\u00a0     Extensive research shows high-deductible plans and deductible amounts on the rise, as Obamacare forces heathcare rationing. From 2009 to 2014, Americans' health insurance premium costs rose by an average of 28 percent, estimates one free-market advocacy group, and insurance experts are predicting more double-digit increases this year.\u00a0     The Restoring Access to Medication Act also requires that the federal government recoup improper Obamacare subsidies. A Senate report revealed that subsidies to Obamacare enrollees later deemed ineligible for coverage amounted to $750 million last year.  \u00a0      \"It's remarkable that Democrats are starting to understand Obamacare's harm to their constituents, as Republicans have been saying, and these provisions passed on suspension,\" said Rep.

While the president will certainly veto the bill, doing so merely underscores its implied promise: elect the right president in 2016, and ObamaCare's days are numbered.\u00a0\u00a0 Passing this reconciliation bill to repeal ObamaCare and sending it to President Obama is a fantastic way to start the new year, and FreedomWorks will score \"yes\" votes for this bill as our first Key Vote on our online congressional scorecard for 2016.\u00a0 Once ObamaCare came into full effect in 2014, some prominent Republicans began suggesting that fighting ObamaCare was a waste a time, that since it is now the law of the land the best we can do is try to fix its worst parts. Passing this reconciliation bill should silence those naysayers, and keep the focus of health care reform where it ought to be - on eliminating ObamaCare in its entirety and enacting real reform in its place.\u00a0 To that end, it is also encouraging that Speaker Paul Ryan has declared his intention to push House Republicans to finally advance an alternative health care reform bill of their own. Hopefully such a bill will adhere to principles of patient-centered care, allowing the innovation and competition of the free market to provide higher quality care accessible to all. You can read and download FreedomWorks' principles for what patient-centered health care reform should look like HERE.\u00a0 As many Americans continue to pay the individual mandate penalties rather than purchase the overpriced, poor-quality insurance plans on the ObamaCare exchanges, as insurance companies continue to pull out of the exchanges and ObamaCare's insurance co-ops fail, and as the massive cost of ObamaCare continues to swell the government's deficit spending, passing this bill provides a fresh breath of optimism that ObamaCare can be stopped before it wrecks our already flawed health care system beyond hope of repair.\u00a0\u00a0 In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolution.com", "clean_text2": "washington govern fail freedom work associ issu follow news releas hous set send presid bill repeal major signatur health care law presid certain veto bill mere underscor impli promis elect right presid 2016 obamacar day number pass reconcili bill repeal obamacar send presid obama fantast way start new year freedomwork score yes vote bill first key vote onlin congression scorecard 2016 obamacar came full effect 2014 promin republican began suggest fight obamacar wast time sinc law land best tri fix worst part pass reconcili bill silenc naysay keep focus health care reform ought elimin obamacar entireti enact real reform place end also encourag speaker paul ryan declar intent push hous republican final advanc altern health care reform bill hope bill adher principl patient center care allow innov competit free market provid higher qualiti care access read download freedomwork principl patient center health care reform look like mani american continu pay individu mandat penalti rather purchas overpr poor qualiti insur plan obamacar exchang insur compani continu pull exchang obamacar insur co op fail massiv cost obamacar continu swell govern deficit spend pass bill provid fresh breath optim obamacar stop wreck alreadi flaw health care system beyond hope repair case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "byline": "", "date": "January 6, 2016 Wednesday", "clean_text": "washington govern fail freedom work associ issu follow news releas hous set send presid bill repeal major signatur health care law presid certain veto bill mere underscor impli promis elect right presid 2016 obamacar day number pass reconcili bill repeal obamacar send presid obama fantast way start new year freedomwork score yes vote bill first key vote onlin congression scorecard 2016 obamacar came full effect 2014 promin republican began suggest fight obamacar wast time sinc law land best tri fix worst part pass reconcili bill silenc naysay keep focus health care reform ought elimin obamacar entireti enact real reform place end also encourag speaker paul ryan declar intent push hous republican final advanc altern health care reform bill hope bill adher principl patient center care allow innov competit free market provid higher qualiti care access read download freedomwork principl patient center health care reform look like mani american continu pay individu mandat penalti rather purchas overpr poor qualiti insur plan obamacar exchang insur compani continu pull exchang obamacar insur co op fail massiv cost obamacar continu swell govern deficit spend pass bill provid fresh breath optim obamacar stop wreck alreadi flaw health care system beyond hope repair case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "title": "A Crucial Victory on the Road to Repealing ObamaCare"}, "45": {"text": "On Monday evening, one of the nation's largest insurers released a statement announcing its intention to stop offering individual coverage in most Obamacare markets. Aetna's announcement, just six paragraphs long, explained that it had lost more than $430 million on the public exchanges since 2014, thanks largely to too many high-cost (read: sick) enrollees.\u00a0Aetna regretted its decision, said CEO Mark Bertolini in the statement, but doing business in the Obamacare marketplaces created \"significant sustainability concerns.\"It's the same complaint other insurers have voiced about Obamacare, and it mirrors what Bertolini said just two weeks ago in a second-quarter earnings call. But earlier this year, Bertolini let slip another figure that didn't make it into Monday's six paragraphs: Aetna enjoyed a record $6.5 billion in government program premiums in the first quarter.In other words, doing business with the government isn't so bad after all. In fact, it's gotten especially good since Obamacare came along, thanks largely to the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid in most states (but not yet North Carolina.) Medicaid, like Medicare, offers the best of most worlds for insurers - it's single-payer, government-financed insurance, and it has low enrollee costs. So while insurers like to gripe about the individual Obamacare exchanges, they have no issues with the big Medicaid profits that Obamacare helps provide.Aetna, at least, seemed to see that big picture not long ago, even calling the Obamacare marketplaces \"a good investment\" in April. What changed? It could be that last month, the Obama administration blocked Aetna's proposed $37 billion merger with Humana. On Wednesday, the Huffington Post revealed a July letter from Bertolini to the Justice Department in which he said that if the merger (and its bottom-line benefits) didn't happen, Aetna would pull out of Obamacare's exchanges.Aetna's about-face, fishy or not, doesn't change that insurers are legitimately losing money in the Obamacare exchanges. Because of that, those state marketplaces are suddenly wobbly.That's troubling, but there are remedies available. Lawmakers could find new ways to give insurers financial relief, including making good on old \"risk corridor\" promises to cover insurers' losses on the exchanges. The administration could try to bring more healthy people into the exchanges with tax credits or higher penalties for declining coverage.The government also could pursue a more radical but perhaps overdue solution of linking the plentiful Medicaid and Medicare Advantage dollars that insurers crave to their participation in the Obamacare exchanges.Those measures and others would require approval from a Republican-led Congress that hasn't been inclined to help the Affordable Care Act get better. We hope the 2016 election will change that dynamic, because despite its struggles, Obamacare has done its job of insuring more Americans and slowing the rise of health care costs.Is it perfect for everyone? No. But for insurers, it's a lot better than they'd have you believe.Charlotte Observer, Aug. 18", "clean_text2": "monday even one nation largest insur releas statement announc intent stop offer individu coverag obamacar market aetna announc six paragraph long explain lost 430 million public exchang sinc 2014 thank larg mani high cost read sick enrolle aetna regret decis said ceo mark bertolini statement busi obamacar marketplac creat signific sustain concern complaint insur voic obamacar mirror bertolini said two week ago second quarter earn call earlier year bertolini let slip anoth figur make monday six paragraph aetna enjoy record 6 5 billion govern program premium first quarter word busi govern bad fact gotten especi good sinc obamacar came along thank larg afford care act expans medicaid state yet north carolina medicaid like medicar offer best world insur singl payer govern financ insur low enrolle cost insur like gripe individu obamacar exchang issu big medicaid profit obamacar help provid aetna least seem see big pictur long ago even call obamacar marketplac good invest april chang could last month obama administr block aetna propos 37 billion merger humana wednesday huffington post reveal juli letter bertolini justic depart said merger bottom line benefit happen aetna would pull obamacar exchang aetna face fishi chang insur legitim lose money obamacar exchang state marketplac sudden wobbl troubl remedi avail lawmak could find new way give insur financi relief includ make good old risk corridor promis cover insur loss exchang administr could tri bring healthi peopl exchang tax credit higher penalti declin coverag govern also could pursu radic perhap overdu solut link plenti medicaid medicar advantag dollar insur crave particip obamacar exchang measur other would requir approv republican led congress inclin help afford care act get better hope 2016 elect chang dynam despit struggl obamacar done job insur american slow rise health care cost perfect everyon insur lot better believ charlott observ aug 18", "byline": "", "date": "August 19, 2016 Friday", "clean_text": "monday even one nation largest insur releas statement announc intent stop offer individu coverag obamacar market aetna announc six paragraph long explain lost 430 million public exchang sinc 2014 thank larg mani high cost read sick enrolle aetna regret decis said ceo mark bertolini statement busi obamacar marketplac creat signific sustain concern complaint insur voic obamacar mirror bertolini said two week ago second quarter earn call earlier year bertolini let slip anoth figur make monday six paragraph aetna enjoy record 6 5 billion govern program premium first quarter word busi govern bad fact gotten especi good sinc obamacar came along thank larg afford care act expans medicaid state yet north carolina medicaid like medicar offer best world insur singl payer govern financ insur low enrolle cost insur like gripe individu obamacar exchang issu big medicaid profit obamacar help provid aetna least seem see big pictur long ago even call obamacar marketplac good invest april chang could last month obama administr block aetna propos 37 billion merger humana wednesday huffington post reveal juli letter bertolini justic depart said merger bottom line benefit happen aetna would pull obamacar exchang aetna face fishi chang insur legitim lose money obamacar exchang state marketplac sudden wobbl troubl remedi avail lawmak could find new way give insur financi relief includ make good old risk corridor promis cover insur loss exchang administr could tri bring healthi peopl exchang tax credit higher penalti declin coverag govern also could pursu radic perhap overdu solut link plenti medicaid medicar advantag dollar insur crave particip obamacar exchang measur other would requir approv republican led congress inclin help afford care act get better hope 2016 elect chang dynam despit struggl obamacar done job insur american slow rise health care cost perfect everyon insur lot better believ charlott observ aug 18", "title": "Aetna is still making money on Obamacare"}, "10": {"text": " Washington: Office of the MP Mark Walker has issued the following news release:\u00a0\u00a0 U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today voted on a budget reconciliation package that repeals Obamacare and defunds Planned Parenthood.

Frank Guinta (NH-01).\u00a0\u00a0     Manchester's former mayor, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare - and succeeded in delaying a 40-percent tax on employee health benefits, which New Hampshire employers said would harm hiring and wages - voted for the legislation, the Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2015, yesterday.\u00a0    Specifically, it lifts Obamacare restrictions on purchasing over-the-counter prescriptions using a health savings account (HSA), increases HSA contribution limits, and expands allowable expenses. HSAs are tax-exempt saving accounts for medical purposes that supplement high-deductible health insurance plans.\u00a0     \"In order to pay for high deductibles under Obamacare, middle- and working-class Granite Staters are turning to HSAs out of necessity. To force participation in a bad healthcare plan, however, the Administration is denying people struggling to make ends meet a sensible alternative,\" said Rep. Guinta. \"We're helping to return some flexibility to their lives.\"\u00a0     Extensive research shows high-deductible plans and deductible amounts on the rise, as Obamacare forces heathcare rationing. From 2009 to 2014, Americans' health insurance premium costs rose by an average of 28 percent, estimates one free-market advocacy group, and insurance experts are predicting more double-digit increases this year.\u00a0     The Restoring Access to Medication Act also requires that the federal government recoup improper Obamacare subsidies. A Senate report revealed that subsidies to Obamacare enrollees later deemed ineligible for coverage amounted to $750 million last year.  \u00a0      \"It's remarkable that Democrats are starting to understand Obamacare's harm to their constituents, as Republicans have been saying, and these provisions passed on suspension,\" said Rep.

Monday that it is dropping Obamacare insurance in 69% of the counties and 11 of 15 states where it currently offers plans.\u00a0The third-largest health insurance company becomes the latest to pull back from the plans offered under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as it cites heavy losses.Q WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR PATIENTS?A: The cuts affect 20% of Aetna's 838,000 Obamacare participants, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The insurer is ending its Obamacare plans in 11 states: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Texas. Participants will be forced to sign up for other Obamacare plans or purchase individual insurance outside of the exchanges once open enrollment begins later this year. Aetna's Obamacare members in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia will be unaffected.Q WHY IS AETNA EXITING?A: The insurer blamed heavy losses for the move. The company suggested that too many sick people are buying plans, not enough healthy people are paying premiums and the government isn't making policy changes to fix it.Q IS THIS LEGAL?A: Yes.

John McCain (R-Ariz.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) today introduced the Protection from Obamacare Monopolies Act, legislation that would protect all individuals who live in a county with one or no healthcare plans available on the Obamacare exchanges from the individual mandate tax.\u00a0\u00a0 Arizona has been hit particularly hard by providers fleeing the federal marketplace after incurring unsustainable financial losses over the last several years. Pinal County, Arizona recently became the first county in America to be left without a single provider in the Obamacare marketplace. Nearly all of Arizona's counties currently have just one health care provider offering health care plans in the exchanges. Last week, Maricopa County, Arizona - the most populous county in the state - became the latest to be left with only one provider in the Obamacare exchanges after Phoenix Health Plans, Inc. announced it would leave the exchanges. This trend is true across the country. According to Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurance company offering health care plans in the Obamacare marketplace.\u00a0 Video of Flake and McCain on the Senate floor discussing the failures of Obamacare in Arizona can be viewed here.\u00a0 \"Obamacare is an unmitigated disaster in Arizona. The exchanges for 13 of the state's 15 counties are devoid of competition because they are left with only a single insurer willing to sell coverage. Another county's exchange has the dubious distinction of being the first in the nation to be completely abandoned by providers. As the administration continues to defend this failed law, we will not wait around for them to fix its mess, which is why we have introduced this legislation to help protect those in Arizona and across the country from unjustifiable financial penalties when they are left without healthcare options,\" said Flake.\u00a0 \"With Phoenix Health Plans, Inc.'s exit from the Obamacare marketplace last week, nearly all of Arizona's counties are now left with either one or no options when it comes to health insurance under Obamacare,\" said McCain. \"This legislation would ensure that Arizonans are not forced to pay more taxes due to the failure of a healthcare system that was fatally flawed from conception. This failed law will only continue to place undue burdens on Arizona families unless we replace it with solutions that put patients back in charge of their health care.\"\u00a0 \"Instead of lowering costs, Obamacare has made things worse: insurance companies across the country are fleeing the exchange market at an alarming rate, premiums have skyrocketed, and networks have become more narrow.  Obamacare is in a death spiral. What's worse, Obamacare will impose a fine on countless individuals who no longer have affordable insurance options in their county,\" said Cotton. \"Hard-working Americans shouldn't face more taxes because President Obama's Obamacare hopes and dreams failed. This bill will provide much needed relief from the Obamacare Mandate penalty and allow Americans to purchase coverage they can afford and that actually meets their healthcare needs.\u00a0 \"As Obamacare continues to crumble, here's the administration's cruel choice for millions of Americans next year: pay Washington's mandate or bite the bullet and pay the only insurance company available on the exchange in your county,\" said Sasse. \"Our simple legislation spares moms and dads from Obamacare's raw deal. For months we've sounded the alarm about Obamacare's lousy choices and unaffordable prices--this whole mess must be repealed but, if Democrats keep trying to defend the indefensible, we should at least help those who are hurt the most.\"\u00a0 \"The definition of 'marketplace' is an economic system in which companies compete with each other to sell their products. It leads to lower prices, higher quality, and a higher level of customer service,\" said Johnson. \"The Obamacare definition of marketplace, by contrast, has resulted in a failed government system that reduces competition and its benefits. Under Obamacare, Wisconsinites can be penalized for not buying a company's product, even when there is only one company selling it. This legislation would help ensure that Wisconsin families won't have to pay a penalty to help cover the cost of Obamacare's failed promise of consumer choice.\"\u00a0 \"A majority of Americans have two or fewer options on the Obamacare exchanges, and 31 percent have only one option,\" said Barrasso. \"When there's only one option, that's not a marketplace, it's a monopoly. This bill provides desperately needed relief for those who are hit the hardest.\"  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com

floor about the broken promises of the Obamacare law.\u00a0\u00a0 Coats described how insurance premiums for policies on the Obamacare Marketplace in Indiana have gone up by an average of 14.4 percent per year since Obamacare was implemented, a total increase of 71.5 percent, based on proposed rate filings for 2017. This equates to a nearly $200 increase each month in the average cost of health care premiums for Hoosiers.\u00a0 \"You may recall that President Obama promised that annual health care costs would be cut by $2,500 per family if Obamacare was enacted,\" said Coats. \"Rather than making health care more affordable and accessible, Obamacare has actually driven up health care costs and decreased choice of doctors for too many American families and businesses. Despite the president's promises, many Americans are experiencing higher premiums or paying outrageous deductibles when they purchase coverage through the Obamacare exchange.\"\u00a0 Coats noted UnitedHealth Group's recent announcement that it will stop selling individual Obamacare plans in Indiana and the growing number of doctors and hospitals who are no longer accepting patients covered by Obamacare insurance plans.\u00a0 \"So much for President Obama's promise that 'if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor,'\" said Coats. \"Decreased access to providers is just one of the many problems with Obamacare. It is long past time for repeal of the president's disastrous health care law.

Participants will be forced to sign up for other Obamacare plans or purchase individual insurance outside of the exchanges once open enrollment begins later this year.Aetna's Obamacare members in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia will be unaffected.Patients may also lose their preferred doctors and hospitals if they sign up for plans that don't include those providers in their network coverage. People in rural areas are most affected.Q Why is Aetna exiting?A: The insurer blamed heavy losses for the move. The company suggested that too many sick people are buying plans, not enough healthy people are paying premiums and the government isn't making policy changes to fix it.But the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) says it has implemented new regulations to make the exchanges more appealing to insurers. The agency says new rules make it more difficult for Americans to abuse the system by buying insurance when they need it and dropping it when they don't, which is illegal and extremely unprofitable for insurers.\"They did respond to some degree,\" but insurers are \"not satisfied\" with the moves, said Marianne Udow-Phillips, director of the Center for Healthcare Research & Transformation at the University of Michigan.Q Will this affect my monthly premium?A: Experts already are forecasting that the premium for an average plan - the lowest-cost medium-benefits option for a 40-year-old non-smoker -- is expected to rise by 9% in 2017 to a monthly payment of $281, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That increase could potentially deter some people from signing up.But most Obamacare plan members will continue to receive tax credit subsidies to help pay for their insurance. HHS reported that 85% of Obamacare plan members received tax credit subsidies and paid only $4 extra per month in 2016.The biggest question for insurers is whether premium increases are enough to offset losses and keep insurers competitive.Q Is this legal?A: Yes. Insurers are not legally obligated to offer plans through the ACA  exchanges.Q Are others doing it?A: Yes. UnitedHealth Group recently ended most of its Obamacare exchanges plans for similar reasons.Q Who's happy about this?A: Conservative advocates who want to demolish Obamacare and replace it.\"Aetna's withdrawal from nearly a dozen exchanges is another sign that Obamacare is unsustainable,\" FreedomWorks CEO Adam Brandon said in a statement. \"Conservatives must demand that Republicans begin to make Obamacare an issue in this election and promote patient-centered solutions that will restore the American health care system.\"But liberals who believe Obamacare doesn't go far enough may use this decision to make a point, too.Q Does this mean fewer people will get Obamacare insurance?A: Not necessarily. But \"this is concerning for the stability of the individual marketplace in many places,\" Udow-Phillips said.Q Is this payback for the Obama administra- tion's effort to block Aetna's acquisition of Humana?A: It depends on whom you ask. Aetna would never say so.But when the Justice Department filed a lawsuit seeking to block the merger in July, Aetna warned that the lawsuit could undermine its Obamacare plans.

Fox News this morning to discuss H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015 which repeals the coercive core of Obamacare and paves the way for patient-centered health care reform. The reconciliation bill is set to be adopted by the House of Representatives tomorrow and will be the first broad Obamacare repeal bill sent to President Obama's desk.\u00a0\u00a0 Excerpts:\u00a0 On the Obamacare repeal effort:\u00a0 \"This is really an important event this week. For the first time, we are going to be able to have a bill pass through the Senate and the House, get it on the president's desk, that repeals Obamacare. That fulfills our responsibility to represent our constituents, and recognize what they know and that is that this law is not only harming the health of so many Americans in many many ways across this country but the health our of economy. So what we will do is put this bill on the president's desk that will repeal Obamacare, and will let the president then say whether or not he stands with the American people or whether he's getting in the way of positive solutions.\"\u00a0 On what a patient-centered health care reform effort looks like:\u00a0 \"It respects the principles that are violated by Obamacare. So, accessibility for every single American but not a mandate that dictates to people what they've got to buy. Affordability. The cost of health care is skyrocketing. We need to bring those costs down. Incentives for the highest quality of health care in the world. Quality is being harmed by Obamacare. And choices. The incredible amount of choices that patients want. They want to be the ones that select who's treating them and where and when and the like. So we'll respect those principles. And when you look at those principles, then you can figure out exactly what the bill ought to look like.

It shouldn't have. Everything that's happened now was predicted by the law's critics years ago.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said that this was supposed to be a break-even year for its ObamaCare business. Instead, the company has already lost $200 million, which it expect that to hit $320 million before the year it out. He said the company was abandoning plans to expand into five other states and is reviewing whether to stay in the 15 states where Aetna (AET)\u00a0current sells ObamaCare plans.\u00a0Aetna's announcement follows UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) decision to leave most ObamaCare markets, Humana's (HUM) decision to drop out of some, Blue Cross Blue Shield's announcement that it was quitting the individual market in Minnesota, and the failure of most of the 23 government-created insurance co-ops. And it follows news that insurance companies are putting in for double-digit rate hikes that in some cases top 60%, and news that the Congressional Budget Office has sharply downgraded its long-term enrollment forecast for the exchanges.Who could have envisioned such problems? Not ObamaCare backers. They were endlessly promising that the law would create vibrant, highly competitive markets that would lower the cost of insurance.Critics, however, were spot on. They said that, despite the individual mandate, ObamaCare wouldn't attract enough young and healthy people to keep premiums down.The Heritage Foundation, for example, said that under ObamaCare, \"many under age 35 will opt out of buying insurance altogether, choosing to pay the penalty instead.\" That's just what has happened.Critics predicted sharp hikes in premiums and big increases in medical claims. That's what's happened.Critics said people would game the system, waiting until they got sick to buy insurance, then canceling it once the bills were paid, because of the law's \"guaranteed issue\" mandate. That's happening, too. In fact, administration officials are trying to tighten the rules to mitigate this problem.Critics said insurers would abandon ObamaCare amid substantial losses. Anyone want to dispute that this is happening?These dire predictions weren't pulled out of thin air. Several states had already tried ObamaCare-style market reforms in the 1990s, only to see their individual insurance markets collapse. A 2007 report by Milliman Inc. looked at eight states that had adopted the \"guaranteed issue\" and \"community rating\" reforms at the heart of ObamaCare.Like Obama, these states wanted to create insurance markets where no one could be denied coverage, or charged more, just because they were sick.\u00a0But Milliman found that these regulations resulted in fast-rising premiums, a drop in enrollment in the individual market, and an exodus of health insurers.Sound familiar?By the time ObamaCare came around, most of those states either abandoned or overhauled this regulatory scheme, only to have it reimposed on them.ObamaCare architects figured they could avoid the fate of those state experiments by including the individual mandate and subsidies for lower income families.However, consulting firm Oliver Wyman correctly predicted\u00a0in 2009that these wouldn't work, either. \"The subsidies and mandates,\" it concluded, \"are not sufficient to drive high participation of younger, healthier members.\"Aetna's Bertolini says that what's needed now to keep ObamaCare functioning are bigger and more generous taxpayer financed insurance subsidies -- i.e., bailouts. Democrats say what's needed is a \"public option\" so that consumers in states abandoned by private insurers will be able to get coverage.How about instead policymakers listen to the original ObamaCare critics? For decades, they've been calling for reforms that lift myriad anti-competitive government regulations, as well as fixes to the tax code so that it no longer massively distorts the insurance market.The resulting free market competition in health care would do what it does everywhere it's allowed to function -- improve quality while improving affordability. In other words, it would achieve the things ObamaCare promised but miserably failed to deliver.", "clean_text2": "http www investor com wp content upload 2016 08 edit5 fail 080416 ap jpgaetna decis

Six years later, many Americans have faced and continue to face outrageous premiums and deductibles.  Instead of expanding competition and access, the recent announcement that Aetna would be withdrawing from Obamacare on the heels of United's announcement that they would also be withdrawing from the exchanges should force us to reevaluate whether, in fact, Obamacare is everything it was promised, particularly from a financial perspective.\u00a0  In Oklahoma, families have faced massive rate increases, thanks to Obamacare. In 2015, the average premium increase for a policy was 12.2 percent--but that was with 4 carriers in the marketplace.  In 2016, because of the rationing of care, the increased bureaucratic morass and additional mandates, and the outrageous costs, half of the insurers exited the marketplace, leaving two insurers, and Oklahomans with an average 31 percent increase over the previous year. 2017 is no better, as UnitedHealth exits the market, leaving just one carrier, and leaving families with another, average proposed premium increase of 49.2 percent. Premiums have more than doubled in just three years.  Beyond its impact on families, Obamacare has had a tremendous negative impact on the federal budget, all while health care costs continue to rise. In fact, CMS continues to project an average yearly increase of 5.8% on healthcare spending through 2024. Since its implementation, it has been a burden on a family's budget, as well as on the federal budget.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the subsidies alone for Obamacare will cost the federal government more than $853 billion in the next ten years. These strains on our families and our national economy are unsustainable.  While Obamacare continues to drain the pockets of many families, and of the federal government, it is certainly draining the pockets of health insurers. Major health insurance company Aetna is just one of the latest companies to recognize the fundamental flaws that face Obamacare. Aetna revealed that its participation in Obamacare has cost them upwards of $430 million since 2014. Similarly, UnitedHealth lost nearly $1 billion in Obamacare-compliant plans in the last two years. Such losses are unsustainable and lead to consolidation, like Aetna's attempted merger with Humana. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice blocked this merger, which hastened the exit of Aetna from the marketplace.  It is not hyperbole to say that Obamacare has effectively destroyed the health care system as we knew it. It will be hard to undo what has been done.  When you burn the house down it can't simply be undone - you have to build a new house.  Fortunately, Republicans have a free market, consumer driven alternative that will restore choice, foster competition, and make access to quality health care easy and affordable for all Americans. It will be a system that will create ease of mind for both the consumer and the insurer, and provide continued protection for all levels of the system. It will lower costs by ending cumbersome mandates and reducing the trillions of dollars in new taxes on health care. Replacing the system will reduce the financial strains on every participant in the system. As we provide more choices, and free market solutions, we will provide security and assurance to all who participate.\u00a0  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact:  editorial@plusmediasolutions.com ", "clean_text2": "washington offic mp tom cole issu follow news releas obamacar creat sold american peopl new plan lower health cost expand access six year later mani american face continu face outrag premium deduct instead expand competit access recent announc aetna would withdraw obamacar heel unit announc would also withdraw exchang forc us reevalu whether fact obamacar everyth promis particular financi perspect oklahoma famili face massiv rate increas thank obamacar 2015 averag premium increas polici 12 2 percent 4 carrier marketplac 2016 ration care increas bureaucrat morass addit mandat outrag cost half insur exit marketplac leav two insur oklahoman averag 31 percent increas previous year 2017 better unitedhealth exit market leav one carrier leav famili anoth averag propos premium increas 49 2 percent premium doubl three year beyond impact famili obamacar tremend negat impact feder budget health care cost continu rise fact cms continu project averag year increas 5 8 healthcar spend 2024 sinc implement burden famili budget well feder budget accord congression budget offic subsidi alon obamacar cost feder govern 853 billion next ten year strain famili nation economi unsustain obamacar continu drain pocket mani famili feder govern certain drain pocket health insur major health insur compani aetna one latest compani recogn fundament flaw face obamacar aetna reveal particip obamacar cost upward 430 million sinc 2014 similar unitedhealth lost near 1 billion obamacar compliant plan last two year loss unsustain lead consolid like aetna attempt merger humana unfortun depart justic block merger hasten exit aetna marketplac hyperbol say obamacar effect destroy health care system knew hard undo done burn hous simpli undon build new hous fortun republican free market consum driven altern restor choic foster competit make access qualiti health care easi afford american system creat eas mind consum insur provid continu protect level system lower cost end cumbersom mandat reduc trillion dollar new tax health care replac system reduc financi strain everi particip system provid choic free market solut provid secur assur particip case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "byline": "", "date": "August 24, 2016 Wednesday", "clean_text": "washington offic mp tom cole issu follow news releas obamacar creat sold american peopl new plan lower health cost expand access six year later mani american face continu face outrag premium deduct instead expand competit access recent announc aetna would withdraw obamacar heel unit announc would also withdraw exchang forc us reevalu whether fact obamacar everyth promis particular financi perspect oklahoma famili face massiv rate increas thank obamacar 2015 averag premium increas polici 12 2 percent 4 carrier marketplac 2016 ration care increas bureaucrat morass addit mandat outrag cost half insur exit marketplac leav two insur oklahoman averag 31 percent increas previous year 2017 better unitedhealth exit market leav one carrier leav famili anoth averag propos premium increas 49 2 percent premium doubl three year beyond impact famili obamacar tremend negat impact feder budget health care cost continu rise fact cms continu project averag year increas 5 8 healthcar spend 2024 sinc implement burden famili budget well feder budget accord congression budget offic subsidi alon obamacar cost feder govern 853 billion next ten year strain famili nation economi unsustain obamacar continu drain pocket mani famili feder govern certain drain pocket health insur major health insur compani aetna one latest compani recogn fundament flaw face obamacar aetna reveal particip obamacar cost upward 430 million sinc 2014 similar unitedhealth lost near 1 billion obamacar compliant plan last two year loss unsustain lead consolid like aetna attempt merger humana unfortun depart justic block merger hasten exit aetna marketplac hyperbol say obamacar effect destroy health care system knew hard undo done burn hous simpli undon build new hous fortun republican free market consum driven altern restor choic foster competit make access qualiti health care easi afford american system creat eas mind consum insur provid continu protect level system lower cost end cumbersom mandat reduc trillion dollar new tax health care replac system reduc financi strain everi particip system provid choic free market solut provid secur assur particip case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "title": "Washington: Obamacare Is A Money Pit"}, "76": {"text": " Washington: Office of the Senator Ron Johnson has issued the following news release:  Sen.

Backers see this as good news, because it means that those needing coverage are getting it. But it's really a sign of an impending death spiral.\u00a0A new report from Blue Cross Blue Shield finds that those who signed up for ObamaCare in 2014 and 2015 had higher rates of various diseases and used \"significantly more\" medical services in their first year of coverage.For example, new enrollees were 25% more likely to have hypertension, 32% more likely to have coronary artery disease and 94% more likely to have diabetes. They had far higher rates of ER visits, prescriptions filled and hospital visits.These statistics could be seen as signs of success. After all, ObamaCare forbids insurers to deny coverage or charge people more for pre-existing conditions. So presumably the numbers indicate that those who had been locked out of the old market really needed the coverage.But to work, ObamaCare also had to bring in more young and healthy people to offset the costs of the older and sicker, and to keep insurance premiums down. Otherwise, the market would enter into a \"death spiral,\" in which higher premiums drive more healthy people out of the market, pushing rates up still further.That was what happened in several states that had already experimented with ObamaCare-style insurance reforms. And it's why ObamaCare included an individual mandate and the sizable penalty for not signing up.It's clearly not working as promised. Enrollment data released in early March show that just 28% of Obama Care enrollees are 18-34 years old. That's the same share as in ObamaCare's first year, despite a huge increase in the penalty for not having insurance.And the Blue Cross report shows that average spending per enrollee in the individual market jumped 12% between 2014 and 2015, suggesting that the Obama Care pool is getting sicker, on average, not healthier.As a result, insurers have reported huge losses on ObamaCare plans and have jacked up rates to try to cover them.

A video version of his remarks with the full script appears below.Obamacare is an unmitigated disaster that has hit Utah's families and small businesses the hardest. That's why, since Obamacare's inception, I have been working tirelessly to repeal the President's signature healthcare law and replace it with a patient-centered alternative that works for all Utahns.\u00a0 In the past year alone, Congress has taken critical steps to scale back some of the most damaging aspects of Obamacare. First, we delayed the Cadillac Tax until 2020. Then, we enacted a one-year moratorium on the Health Insurance Tax--a tax that could have a disastrous effect on America's job creators by increasing average premiums for small businesses by more than $200 dollars per employee.\u00a0 Since last July, Obamacare has forced small Utah's small businesses to pay a special excise tax that affects how they can help employees pay their insurance premiums and medical expenses. Small business owners are rightly upset with this unfair tax because it hurts their bottom lines and destroys their ability to compete.\u00a0 I want to help Utah's employers. That's why I am working to advance a bill called the Small Business Health Care Relief Act, which would allow small businesses that have 50 employees or fewer to offer Health Reimbursement Accounts to their employees without being subject to taxes. Small businesses play a crucial role in our innovative, growing economy, and they deserve our help.\u00a0 I will continue fighting to cut costs for small businesses purchasing health insurance coverage, and I invite anyone--Republican or Democrat--to join me in this effort. \u00a0  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com ", "clean_text2": "washington offic senat orrin hatch issu follow news releas today senat orrin hatch r utah chairman senat financ committe gave updat commit repeal obamacar support utah famili busi hurt presid signatur healthcar law senat hatch deliv statement obamacar subcommitte primari health retir secur video version remark full script appear obamacar unmitig disast hit utah famili small busi hardest sinc obamacar incept work tireless repeal presid signatur healthcar law replac patient center altern work utahn past year alon congress taken critic step scale back damag aspect obamacar first delay cadillac tax 2020 enact one year moratorium health insur tax tax could disastr effect america job creator increas averag premium small busi 200 dollar per employe sinc last juli obamacar forc small utah small busi pay special excis tax affect help employe pay insur premium medic expens small busi owner right upset unfair tax hurt bottom line destroy abil compet want help utah employ work advanc bill call small busi health care relief act would allow small busi 50 employe fewer offer health reimburs account employe without subject tax small busi play crucial role innov grow economi deserv help continu fight cut cost small busi purchas health insur coverag invit anyon republican democrat join effort case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "byline": "W.

By allowing the crippled health care law to remain on life support for all of 2016, Obama and the Democrats handed Republicans a winning campaign issue for retaking the White House in the 2016 election. Obamacare's miserable failure is the primary reason why Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives in 2010 and the Senate in 2014. Republicans had even greater successes at the state level, and now control more legislative chambers (and by wider margins) than ever before. Bills to repeal Obamacare had previously passed the House, but this time a major repeal bill made it through the Senate using the process of \"reconciliation\" which requires a 51-vote simple majority. The bill would have stopped the expansion of Medicaid, ended the mandates on individuals and employers to buy health insurance, cut off federal subsidies, repealed the \"Cadillac tax\" on premium plans, removed the taxes on medical devices, and even defunded Planned Parenthood.\u00a0\u00a0 Americans are impatient at the slow progress toward repeal of Obamacare, but our Constitution generally requires at least two elections to intervene before any major change can be accomplished. The repeal of Obamacare proves that the entire law can really be repealed as soon as a Republican President takes office.\u00a0 The failure of Obamacare, and the need to repeal it, could become the winning campaign issue to end eight years of control of the White House by Democrats. The more that Obama and Democrats cling to Obamacare, the more Republicans should insist on its repeal.

Private, charity-run hospitals staffed by volunteers provided a safety net for those who could not afford health care. Most doctors also willingly provided free or reduced-price care.The decision of several major insurance companies to cut their losses and withdraw from the Obamacare exchanges, combined with the failure of 70 percent of Obamacare's health insurance \"co-ops,\" will leave one in six Obamacare enrollees with only one health insurance option.\u00a0Those lucky enough to obtain insurance will face ever-increasing premiums and a declining choice of providers.Many Obamacare supporters claimed that the exchanges created a market for health insurance that would allow consumers to benefit from competition.But allowing consumers to pick from a variety of government-controlled health insurance plans is not a true market; instead it is what the great economist Ludwig von Mises called \"playing market.\"Too many are drawing the wrong lessons from Obamacare's difficulties.Instead of calling for a repeal of Obamacare and all other government interference in the health care market, many are calling for increased penalties on those who defy Obamacare's individual mandate in order to force them onto the exchanges. Others are renewing the push for a \"public option,\" forcing private companies to compete with taxpayer-funded entities and easing the way for the adoption of a Canadian-style single payer system.Even those working to restore individual control over health care via tax deductions, credits, and expanded health savings accounts still support government intervention in order to provide a \"safety net\" for the poor. Of course, everyone - including libertarians - shares the goal of creating a safety net. Libertarians just understand that a moral and effective safety net is one voluntarily provided by individuals, religious organizations, and private charities.Government has no legitimate authority to take money from taxpayers to fund health care or any other type of welfare program. Government-run health care also does not truly serve the interest of those supposedly \"benefiting\" from the program. Anyone who doubts this should consider how declining reimbursements and increasing bureaucracy is causing more doctors to refuse to treat Medicaid and Medicare patients.Contrary to myth, low-income individuals did not go without care in the days before the welfare state. Private, charity-run hospitals staffed by volunteers provided a safety net for those who could not afford health care. Most doctors also willingly provided free or reduced-price care for those who needed it. The large amount of charitable giving and volunteer activity in the United States shows that the American people do not need government's help in providing an effective safety net.The problems plaguing the health care system are rooted in the treatment of health care as a \"right.\" This justifies government intervention in the health care marketplace. This intervention causes increasing prices and declining quality and supply. Ironically, those who suffer most from government intervention are the very people proponents of these programs claim to want to help.The first step in restoring a health care system that meets the needs of all people is to start treating health care as a good that can and should only be provided via voluntary actions of free people.Ron Paul is a former congressman and presidential candidate.

Washington: Office of the Senator John Barrasso, U.S Government has issued the following news release:  Today, U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor regarding how the president's health care law is \"very near collapse.\"\u00a0 Barrasso points out that, one by one, insurers are dropping out of Obamacare and leaving Americans with less choice for health insurance.\u00a0\u00a0 Excerpts of Senator Barrasso's remarks:\u00a0 \"I can still remember the president back in 2009, when he gave his speech to Congress, he said, 'In 34 states, 75 percent of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies.'\u00a0 \"The president said that 'without competition, the price of insurance goes up,' and he said that 'quality goes down.'\u00a0 \"That's what President Obama said seven years ago. He said that five options or fewer was such a threat to competition and to quality of care for American families that he needed to create his very own entire Obamacare system.\u00a0 \"So what's the situation today? One-third of America will have only one Obamacare insurer in 2017.\u00a0 \"Millions of Americans will have fewer choices in 2017 than when they had in 2016, with a third of the country having only one option for coverage next year.\u00a0 \"The Obama administration said that these were supposed to be competitive marketplaces.\u00a0 \"When there's only one company selling a product in an area, that's not competition - that's a monopoly.\u00a0 \"When you're down to one choice, basically you have no choice. Except for the people in Pinal County, Arizona, they actually have no choices.\u00a0 \"No one wants to sell insurance to the people that live there, none. It is an Obamacare ghost town.\u00a0 \"What does President Obama say about that?\u00a0 \"It's gotten so bad in some places that the Obamacare exchanges are being called by state insurance commissioners 'very near collapse.'\u00a0 \"The insurance commissioner in Tennessee described the situation in her state as very near collapse.\u00a0\u00a0Obamacare Premiums Set to Skyrocket\u00a0 \"People in Tennessee who get Obamacare insurance will be paying as much as 62 percent more starting in January.\u00a0 \"In Illinois, they're going to be paying 45 percent more next year. In Georgia, 33 percent more.\u00a0 \"These aren't just proposed increases; these are increases that have been approved by the insurance commissioners of those states.\u00a0 \"Premiums are going through the roof, Americans are stuck with fewer options - because the insurance companies just can't afford to sell on the exchanges due to the rules and regulations and the mandates of the exchanges.\u00a0 \"People living in a third of the country won't have any choice next year - all they'll have to deal with is an Obamacare health insurance monopoly, heading to Obamacare no man's land.\u00a0 \"Companies are giving up because people don't want Obamacare insurance, people can't afford it, they're not buying it, they say for them it's not a good deal.\u00a0 Creating Real Competition--Not Obamacare Monopolies\u00a0 \"Obamacare has failed - and Democrats cannot fix it by making it larger.\u00a0 \"In one-third of the counties in America, people won't have a choice for where they buy their health insurance starting November 1st.\u00a0 \"America does have a choice when it comes to fixing our broken health care system.\u00a0 \"We can choose to get rid of Obamacare - and to put in place solutions that we know actually will work for people.\u00a0 \"It means letting people get out from under the burden of all the Washington mandates, and it's the mandates that are really the cause of these devastating price increases.\u00a0 \"You want to create real competition, not Obamacare monopolies.\u00a0 \"Letting people choose the coverage, and the cost, that is right for them and their families - not what Washington says is right for them.\u00a0 \"It's time for Democrats to work with us to give the American people the health care that they want, that they need and

Aetna's announcement, just six paragraphs long, explained that it had lost more than $430 million on the public exchanges since 2014, thanks largely to too many high-cost (read: sick) enrollees.\u00a0Aetna regretted its decision, CEO Mark Bertolini said in the statement, but doing business in the Obamacare marketplaces created \"significant sustainability concerns.\"It's the same complaint other insurers have voiced about Obamacare, and it mirrors what Bertolini said just two weeks ago in a second-quarter earnings call. But earlier this year, Bertolini let slip another figure that didn't make it into Monday's six paragraphs: Aetna enjoyed a record $6.5 billion in government program premiums in the first quarter.In other words, doing business with the government isn't so bad after all. In fact, it's gotten especially good since Obamacare came along, thanks largely to the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid in most states. Medicaid, like Medicare, offers the best of most worlds for insurers -- it's single-payer, government-financed insurance, and it has low enrollee costs. So while insurers like to gripe about the individual Obamacare exchanges, they have no issues with the big Medicaid profits that Obamacare helps provide.Aetna, at least, seemed to see that big picture not long ago, even calling the Obamacare marketplaces \"a good investment\" in April. What changed? It could be that last month, the Obama administration blocked Aetna's proposed $37 billion merger with Humana. On Wednesday, the Huffington Post revealed a July letter from Bertolini to the Justice Department in which he said that if the merger (and its bottom-line benefits) didn't happen, Aetna would pull out of Obamacare's exchanges.Aetna's about-face, fishy or not, doesn't change that insurers are legitimately losing money in the Obamacare exchanges. That's troubling, but there are remedies available. Lawmakers could find new ways to give insurers financial relief, including making good on old \"risk corridor\" promises to cover insurers' losses on the exchanges. The administration could try to bring more healthy people into the exchanges with tax credits or higher penalties for declining coverage.The government also could pursue a more radical but perhaps overdue solution of linking the plentiful Medicaid and Medicare Advantage dollars that insurers crave to their participation in the Obamacare exchanges.Those measures and others would require approval from a Republican-led Congress that hasn't been inclined to help the Affordable Care Act get better. We hope the 2016 election will change that dynamic because, despite its struggles, Obamacare has done its job of insuring more Americans and slowing the rise of health care costs.Charlotte Observer (Aug. 18)", "clean_text2": "one nation largest insur recent releas statement announc intent stop offer individu coverag obamacar market aetna announc six paragraph long explain lost 430 million public exchang sinc 2014 thank larg mani high cost read sick enrolle aetna regret decis ceo mark bertolini said statement busi obamacar marketplac creat signific sustain concern complaint insur voic obamacar mirror bertolini said two week ago second quarter earn call earlier year bertolini let slip anoth figur make monday six paragraph aetna enjoy record 6 5 billion govern program premium first quarter word busi govern bad fact gotten especi good sinc obamacar came along thank larg afford care act expans medicaid state medicaid like medicar offer best world insur singl payer govern financ insur low enrolle cost insur like gripe individu obamacar exchang issu big medicaid profit obamacar help provid aetna least seem see big pictur long ago even call obamacar marketplac good invest april chang could last month obama administr block aetna propos 37 billion merger humana wednesday huffington post reveal juli letter bertolini justic depart said merger bottom line benefit happen aetna would pull obamacar exchang aetna face fishi chang insur legitim lose money obamacar exchang troubl remedi avail lawmak could find new way give insur financi relief includ make good old risk corridor promis cover insur loss exchang administr could tri bring healthi peopl exchang tax credit higher penalti declin coverag govern also could pursu radic perhap overdu solut link plenti medicaid medicar advantag dollar insur crave particip obamacar exchang measur other would requir approv republican led congress inclin help afford care act get better hope 2016 elect chang dynam despit struggl obamacar done job insur american slow rise health care cost charlott observ aug 18", "byline": "", "date": "August 22, 2016 Monday", "clean_text": "one nation largest insur recent releas statement announc intent stop offer individu coverag obamacar market aetna announc six paragraph long explain lost 430 million public exchang sinc 2014 thank larg mani high cost read sick enrolle aetna regret decis ceo mark bertolini said statement busi obamacar marketplac creat signific sustain concern complaint insur voic obamacar mirror bertolini said two week ago second quarter earn call earlier year bertolini let slip anoth figur make monday six paragraph aetna enjoy record 6 5 billion govern program premium first quarter word busi govern bad fact gotten especi good sinc obamacar came along thank larg afford care act expans medicaid state medicaid like medicar offer best world insur singl payer govern financ insur low enrolle cost insur like gripe individu obamacar exchang issu big medicaid profit obamacar help provid aetna least seem see big pictur long ago even call obamacar marketplac good invest april chang could last month obama administr block aetna propos 37 billion merger humana wednesday huffington post reveal juli letter bertolini justic depart said merger bottom line benefit happen aetna would pull obamacar exchang aetna face fishi chang insur legitim lose money obamacar exchang troubl remedi avail lawmak could find new way give insur financi relief includ make good old risk corridor promis cover insur loss exchang administr could tri bring healthi peopl exchang tax credit higher penalti declin coverag govern also could pursu radic perhap overdu solut link plenti medicaid medicar advantag dollar insur crave particip obamacar exchang measur other would requir approv republican led congress inclin help afford care act get better hope 2016 elect chang dynam despit struggl obamacar done job insur american slow rise health care cost charlott observ aug 18", "title": "Aetna's love-hate Obamacare relationship"}, "13": {"text": " Washington: Independent Women's Forum's Association has issued the followiAng news release:   ObamaCare has been such a mess that it appears that Democrats are beginning to bail on it.\u00a0\u00a0 That surfaced in a Kaiser Family Foundation survey released late last week that shows public discontent with the law that was supposed to cure most of the problems with our health care system. Investor's Business Daily reports:\u00a0     When asked specifically about health care, the two top issues are the \"Affordable Care Act\" and \"health care costs.\" In other words, the biggest health care concerns people have right now are the law Obama signed, and the problem it was supposed to address.\u00a0     Even Democrats are growing restive with ObamaCare, with 25% of Democrats now saying they have an unfavorable view of the law, up from 19% last month.\u00a0     To be sure, a big chunk of this group (40%) wants the law expanded to cover more people (despite the fact that this is what ObamaCare itself was supposed to achieve), but 28% of these Democrats now say ObamaCare should either be repealed or scaled back.\u00a0 Passing ObamaCare without input from the out of power party was an act of hubris: health care needed to be reformed, but to work it had to be both incremental and bipartisan. Instead, Democrats took advantage of a brief, shining moment when they had the presidency and both houses of Congress to ramrod an unpopular bill through Congress. Even then, it took arm-twisting, unsavory deals and unusual parliamentary maneuvers to get ObamaCare the votes it needed. Not a single Republican voted for it.\u00a0 And this mess is the result. IBD adds:\u00a0     The public's view of the law is not likely to improve much when insurers start to announce their proposed rate hikes for 2017. Next year marks the end of ObamaCare's $25 billion temporary \"reinsurance\" program, which was basically a subsidy scheme designed to hold down premiums in ObamaCare's first three years.\u00a0     By all accounts, now that insurers will have to price their policies to reflect the true cost of ObamaCare coverage, enrollees are in for the rate shocks of their lives. That could, in turn, cause further problems with enrollment as well as the stability and viability of the ObamaCare exchanges.\u00a0     No matter who ends up in the White House next year, there is no question that ObamaCare's compounding failures will require the next president to \"take up this cause\" again.\u00a0 Assuming that we have not entered an entirely post-ideas epoch, there are so many good plans and proposals out there for reform health care.

They say it has provided insurance coverage to millions of Americans and comes in below cost.They are right to claim that many Americans have benefited from the law. But the benefits are overstated, and the law's harms look set to rise.The drop in the number of Americans without insurance is the biggest accomplishment. But that decline has not been as large as originally estimated. When the law passed, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that by the end of 2015 an additional 15 million people would be getting coverage through Medicaid and 13 million would be getting coverage through the exchanges. Now the CBO says that 10 million additional people were on Medicaid, and the administration says that 8.8 million were on the exchanges, in 2015.\u00a0Still, those are real gains. The people covered now have a measure of financial security they had not previously enjoyed. Yet Medicaid coverage does not appear to be associated with significant improvements in recipients' physical health. And the benefits are low compared with the costs: A recent study found that every dollar spent on the program yielded 20 to 40 cents in benefits.Other people have seen their financial security reduced because of Obamacare. Deductibles in employer health plans have been rising fast, leaving many people with policies that thanks to Obamacare regulations cover routine medical expenses but leave them on the hook for thousands of dollars in a medical emergency. A sensible insurance policy would have the opposite priorities.Obama famously said that Obamacare would bring family premiums down by $2,500. That hasn't happened, of course: Average family premiums for employer coverage went to $17,545 in 2015 from $13,375 in 2009. The administration argues that the law has contributed to a slowdown in the growth of health spending. But that slowdown started in 2002. Obamacare can't be the cause.The CBO believes that the law is having a negative effect on employment. It projects that Americans next year will work the equivalent of 2 million fewer jobs because of the law. That's partly because the law's subsidies decline when people work more. The subsidies thus reduce the rewards to work and induce people to work less.Obamacare was a badly designed law. We could have achieved gains in insurance coverage without Obamacare's regulation heavy approach; we could have addressed the health care system's discrete problems without trying to overhaul it from Washington, D.C.Those without access to employer health plans could have been given enough money to buy a policy that protected them against catastrophic expenses and that offered more protection if they put some of their own income into the policy. Modest regulatory changes could have been made to make it easier for people with pre existing conditions to get coverage, too.Neither Republicans nor Democrats, for different reasons, were interested in going down that path when Obamacare was being debated. Now, belatedly, some Republicans are interested in moving the health system in this direction. The Democratic response to dissatisfaction with Obamacare, on the other hand, is likely to be to blame the law's failures on health care providers and seek tighter regulations of them.One way or the other, though, Obamacare will probably have to be changed substantially under the next president even if Democrats, amid their anniversary celebrations, are loathe to admit it.", "clean_text2":

But in fact, it's an ominous sign that ObamaCare is losing what little luster it had in the marketplace.First off, 11.3 million is nothing to celebrate when you consider that at the end of open enrollment last year, the administration claimed that 11.7 million had signed up. By the end of the entire year, that number had been whittled down to about 9 million, of which 8.2 million re-enrolled.More will no doubt sign up before open enrollment ends on Jan. 31. Even so, the numbers are likely be only marginally improved from last year's.And they will be a far cry from the 20 million that the Congressional Budget Office had been expecting, and far fewer than insurance industry experts say are needed to keep the ObamaCare insurance pools stable.The administration also brags that ObamaCare exchanges attracted 2.5 million new customers to its Healthcare.gov site. But that's significantly fewer than the 4.7 million new customers it got last year. Most businesses would look at that trend with concern, not pride.Meanwhile, the young and healthy continue to avoid Obama Care. The administration says 26% of enrollees are 18 to 34 years old. That's the same share as last year at this time and lower than the 28% in ObamaCare's first year. And it's well below the 40% that the administration had said was needed to keep the ObamaCare insurance markets stable.And by the way, Gallup's report on the uninsured -- which the administration happily paraded about when it showed the number going down -- finds that it climbed to 11.9% at the end of last year, the second quarterly increase.As IBD's Jed Graham aptly put it: \"The Obama administration has shifted expectations about Obama Care to such an extent that the latest enrollment data were, quite remarkably, reported as good news.\"It's one thing for the White House to put a high gloss on these unhappy numbers, but it's an indictment of the mainstream press that it's willing to swallow it whole.", "clean_text2": "health care white hous see year obamacar enrol anoth big win even law ardent support perhap especi peopl worri number presid sure laud obamacar final state union speech tuesday doubt boast 11 3 million peopl enrol obamacar exchang end year may look like unpreced demand obama administr offici fact omin sign obamacar lose littl luster marketplac first 11 3 million noth celebr consid end open enrol last year administr claim 11 7 million sign end entir year number whittl 9 million 8 2 million enrol doubt sign open enrol end jan 31 even number like margin improv last year far cri 20 million congression budget offic expect far fewer insur industri expert say need keep obamacar insur pool stabl administr also brag obamacar exchang attract 2 5 million new custom healthcar gov site signific fewer 4 7 million new custom got last year busi would look trend concern pride meanwhil young healthi continu avoid obama care administr say 26 enrolle 18 34 year old share last year time lower 28 obamacar first year well 40 administr said need keep obamacar insur market stabl way gallup report uninsur administr happili parad show number go find climb 11 9 end last year second quarter increas ibd jed graham apt put obama administr shift expect obama care extent latest enrol data quit remark report good news one thing white hous put high gloss unhappi number indict mainstream press will swallow whole", "byline": "", "date": "January 12, 2016 Tuesday", "clean_text": "health care white hous see year obamacar enrol anoth big win even law ardent support perhap especi peopl worri number presid sure laud obamacar final state union speech tuesday doubt boast 11 3 million peopl enrol obamacar exchang end year may look like unpreced demand obama administr offici fact omin sign obamacar lose littl luster marketplac first 11 3 million noth celebr consid end open enrol last year administr claim 11 7 million sign end entir year number whittl 9 million 8 2 million enrol doubt sign open enrol end jan 31 even number like margin improv last year far cri 20 million congression budget offic expect far fewer insur industri expert say need keep obamacar insur pool stabl administr also brag obamacar exchang attract 2 5 million new custom healthcar gov site signific fewer 4 7 million new custom got last year busi would look trend concern pride meanwhil young healthi continu avoid obama care administr say 26 enrolle 18 34 year old share last year time lower 28 obamacar first year well 40 administr said need keep obamacar insur market stabl way gallup report uninsur administr happili parad show number go find climb 11 9 end last year second quarter increas ibd jed graham apt put obama administr shift expect obama care extent latest enrol data quit remark report good news one thing white hous put high gloss unhappi number indict mainstream press will swallow whole", "title": "Obama Sells A Lemon"}, "39": {"text": " Washington: Eagle Forum has issued the following news release:    President Obama's eighth veto of his presidency came in January, when he nixed legislation passed by Congress to repeal major portions of Obamacare. By allowing the crippled health care law to remain on life support for all of 2016, Obama and the Democrats handed Republicans a winning campaign issue for retaking the White House in the 2016 election. Obamacare's miserable failure is the primary reason why Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives in 2010 and the Senate in 2014. Republicans had even greater successes at the state level, and now control more legislative chambers (and by wider margins) than ever before. Bills to repeal Obamacare had previously passed the House, but this time a major repeal bill made it through the Senate using the process of \"reconciliation\" which requires a 51-vote simple majority. The bill would have stopped the expansion of Medicaid, ended the mandates on individuals and employers to buy health insurance, cut off federal subsidies, repealed the \"Cadillac tax\" on premium plans, removed the taxes on medical devices, and even defunded Planned Parenthood.\u00a0\u00a0 Americans are impatient at the slow progress toward repeal of Obamacare, but our Constitution generally requires at least two elections to intervene before any major change can be accomplished. The repeal of Obamacare proves that the entire law can really be repealed as soon as a Republican President takes office.\u00a0 The failure of Obamacare, and the need to repeal it, could become the winning campaign issue to end eight years of control of the White House by Democrats. The more that Obama and Democrats cling to Obamacare, the more Republicans should insist on its repeal.

My legislation will give members of Congress the opportunity to fix what is so clearly broken and finally end Washington's Obamacare Exemption.\"\u00a0 Vitter's new legislation will not touch Congressional staff.\u00a0 \"Every time a Member of Congress objected to my legislation to end the Washington Exemption from Obamacare, he or she hid behind wanting to protect their staff's subsidy. I know we all respect our un-elected staff members a great deal so I'm giving my colleagues an opportunity to stand up and take responsibility for themselves &ndash; and get rid of the illegal taxpayer funded subsidy that most Members are currently collecting,\" said Vitter.\u00a0 Earlier today, Vitter spoke on the Senate Floor regarding the history of Washington's Obamacare Exemption, including how Congressional leaders met with the White House to concoct a scheme that would protect their own subsidy even though the law that passed said that Congress must purchase their health care through a normal state based exchange. Vitter reaffirmed his hold on the nomination of Beth Cobert to be Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) until Washington's Obamacare Exemption has been corrected either legislatively or administratively.\u00a0 As Chairman of the Senate Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee (SBC), Vitter has been investigating how the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives &ndash; both of which are large employers &ndash; were allowed to apply to the DC Healthlink small business exchange in order to receive special Obamacare taxpayer-funded subsidies available for only small businesses. Media reports have revealed that once Members of Congress realized they would lose their taxpayer-funded healthcare plans as of January 1, 2014, senior Congressional officials worked with the White House and OPM to find a workaround in late 2013, which resulted in OPM's promulgation of the rule allowing Congress to purchase health insurance as a small business.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ben Sasse (R-NE), and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) today in introducing the Protection from Obamacare Monopolies Act, legislation that would protect Wisconsinites who live in a county with less than two insurers offering Obamacare exchange plans from the individual mandate penalty.  \u00a0\u00a0 Three counties in western Wisconsin had just one health care provider offering health care plans in the Obamacare marketplace in 2016: Polk, St. Croix and Pierce County. In 2017, it is expected that Menominee County will be added to that list. Nationally, according to Kaiser Family Foundation, the number of Obamacare exchange enrollees with only one insurer to choose from is estimated to jump from 2% for 2016 to 19% for 2017.\u00a0 Sen. Johnson said this: \"The definition of 'marketplace' is an economic system in which companies compete with each other to sell their products. It leads to lower prices, higher quality, and a higher level of customer service. The Obamacare definition of marketplace, by contrast, has resulted in a failed government system that reduces competition and its benefits. Under Obamacare, Wisconsinites can be penalized for not buying a company's product, even when there is only one company selling it. This legislation would help ensure that Wisconsin families won't have to pay a penalty to help cover the cost of Obamacare's failed promise of consumer choice.\"  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com ", "clean_text2": "washington offic senat ron johnson issu follow news releas sen ron johnson r wis join senat john mccain r az tom cotton r ar ben sass r ne jeff flake r az today introduc protect obamacar monopoli act legisl would protect wisconsinit live counti less two insur offer obamacar exchang plan individu mandat penalti three counti western wisconsin one health care provid offer health care plan obamacar marketplac 2016 polk st croix pierc counti 2017 expect menomine counti ad list nation accord kaiser famili foundat number obamacar exchang enrolle one insur choos estim jump 2 2016 19 2017 sen johnson said definit marketplac econom system compani compet sell product lead lower price higher qualiti higher level custom servic obamacar definit marketplac contrast result fail govern system reduc competit benefit obamacar wisconsinit penal buy compani product even one compani sell legisl would help ensur wisconsin famili pay penalti help cover cost obamacar fail promis consum choic case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "byline": "", "date": "September 7, 2016 Wednesday", "clean_text": "washington offic senat ron johnson issu follow news releas sen ron johnson r wis join senat john mccain r az tom cotton r ar ben sass r ne jeff flake r az today introduc protect obamacar monopoli act legisl would protect wisconsinit live counti less two insur offer obamacar exchang plan individu mandat penalti three counti western wisconsin one health care provid offer health care plan obamacar marketplac 2016 polk st croix pierc counti 2017 expect menomine counti ad list nation accord kaiser famili foundat number obamacar exchang enrolle one insur choos estim jump 2 2016 19 2017 sen johnson said definit marketplac econom system compani compet sell product lead lower price higher qualiti higher level custom servic obamacar definit marketplac contrast result fail govern system reduc competit benefit obamacar wisconsinit penal buy compani product even one compani sell legisl would help ensur wisconsin famili pay penalti help cover cost obamacar fail promis consum choic case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "title": "Washington: Johnson Introduces Bill to Protect Wisconsinites from Failure of Obamacare"}, "24": {"text": "Health Reform: By now, ObamaCare was supposed to have 21 million enrollees. A new study says it's not likely to attract 15 million. Even for government work, that's a big miss.\u00a0President Obama has been bragging about ObamaCare's great \"successes\" in the run-up to its sixth anniversary, including the claim that 20 million have gained coverage (highly dubious) and that health care inflation is low (which has little to do with the law).But as the years progress, it's the failings of Obama Care that have become more apparent.The latest evidence of this is from a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation -- which has been supportive of the law -- that says overall paid enrollment is likely to top out at 14.7 million.That's almost 10 million shy of what the Congressional Budget Office had originally projected ObamaCare would enroll. And it means that ObamaCare will only sign up about half of the \"potential market.\"And, to add further perspective, there were 15 million people who bought individual insurance plans before ObamaCare, a number that Obama himself once dismissed as an insignificant 5% of the insurance market.Kaiser says one reason for the sharp drop in enrollment expectations is that employers aren't dumping as many people into the exchanges as the CBO had expected. But that's a marginal reason at best, since the CBO originally expected few to lose work-based coverage as a result of the law.Many also continue to buy plans outside the exchanges, the report says. That's another sign of ObamaCare's failure, since the exchanges were billed as a fantastic new service that would let consumers easily compare plans, a la Travelocity.Kaiser does finally get around to the nut of the problem with ObamaCare: affordability.Even though the official name of the law is the \"Affordable Care Act,\" Kaiser says that \"the overwhelming reason why people who are uninsured say they are uncovered is cost.\" In fact, most of the uninsured said they tried to get a plan but found it too expensive.That's backed up by a recent survey sponsored by National Public Radio and the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation. Among its startling findings, 34% say the cost of health care has gotten less affordable over the past two years, compared with just 9% who say it's more affordable. Forty-five percent say premiums have gone up, compared with 4% who said insurance is cheaper.The kicker is the survey's finding that 25% of Americans say ObamaCare has \"directly hurt\" them, compared with 15% who say it's \"directly helped.\"The problem is that if few sign up for ObamaCare plans, the markets will remain unstable and will be less attractive for private insurers.Add to all this the billions wasted on failed insurance co-ops and failed state exchanges, the skyrocketing premiums, rising deductibles, access problems for those with ObamaCare plans, big insurance losses, and the fact that ObamaCare will still leave tens of million uninsured.No wonder the administration has to make things up about ObamaCare to brag about.", "clean_text2": "health reform obamacar suppos 21 million

Now they're noticeably silent as insurers post huge losses.\u00a0\"It turns out that the law that the insurance industry's shills demonized has been awfully good to insurance-company investors.\" That was from a piece in the Huffington Post almost exactly a year ago, after UnitedHealth Group released its Q1 earnings.The writer went on to point out that the good news was reported in IBD, and that our editorial page has long been critical of the law. \"I can't wait,\" Wendell Potter concluded, \"to see how IBD's editorial writers spin UnitedHealth's ObamaCare success.\"We can't wait to see how Potter and other ObamaCare fans are spinning the law's \"success,\" now that insurance companies are showing big, sustained losses and threatening to pull out of the program next year.The latest to join the list is Humana, which just reported that profits fell 30% in the last quarter of 2015 and has set aside a reserve for expected losses this year. It's now saying it \"continues to evaluate its participation\" in the individual insurance market.A few days earlier, Aetna said it lost up to 4% on its ObamaCare policies in 2015 and said it had \"serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges.\"And UnitedHealth Group said it expects losses from its ObamaCare enrollees to top $650 million this year and next. \"We cannot sustain these losses,\" is how CEO Stephen Hemsley put it.Humana, as with other insurers, discovered that ObamaCare enrollees were sicker and more expensive to cover than they anticipated. And worse, they're finding that ObamaCare officials are letting too many people game the system by waiting until after they are sick to enroll for coverage, knowing they can get it guaranteed.Spiraling premiums, an unstable insurance market, people gaming the system  -- these were predictions made by ObamaCare's free market critics, including IBD, who said this is where the law's mountain of regulations would inevitably lead.So, what say you now, ObamaCare fans?", "clean_text2": "health reform long ago obamacar fan wag finger critic say industri profit prove law work notic silent insur post huge loss turn law insur industri shill demon aw good insur compani investor piec huffington post almost exact year ago unitedhealth group releas q1 earn writer went point good news report ibd editori page long critic law wait wendel potter conclud see ibd editori writer spin unitedhealth obamacar success wait see potter obamacar fan spin law success insur compani show big sustain loss threaten pull program next year latest join list humana report profit fell 30 last quarter 2015 set asid reserv expect loss year say continu evalu particip individu insur market day earlier aetna said lost 4 obamacar polici 2015 said serious concern sustain public exchang unitedhealth group said expect loss obamacar enrolle top 650 million year next sustain loss ceo stephen hemsley put humana insur discov obamacar enrolle sicker expens cover anticip wors find obamacar offici let mani peopl game system wait sick enrol coverag know get guarante spiral premium unstabl insur market peopl game system predict made obamacar free market critic includ ibd said law mountain regul would inevit lead say obamacar fan", "byline": "", "date": "February 12, 2016 Friday", "clean_text": "health reform long ago obamacar fan wag finger critic say industri profit prove law work notic silent insur post huge loss turn law insur industri shill demon aw good insur compani investor piec huffington post almost exact year ago unitedhealth group releas q1 earn writer went point good news report ibd editori page long critic law wait wendel potter conclud see ibd editori writer spin unitedhealth obamacar success wait see potter obamacar fan spin law success insur compani show big sustain loss threaten pull program next year latest join list humana report profit fell 30 last quarter 2015 set asid reserv expect loss year say continu evalu particip individu insur market day earlier aetna said lost 4 obamacar polici 2015 said serious concern sustain public exchang unitedhealth group said expect loss obamacar enrolle top 650 million year next sustain loss ceo stephen hemsley put humana insur discov obamacar enrolle sicker expens cover anticip wors find obamacar offici let mani peopl game system wait sick enrol coverag know get guarante spiral premium unstabl insur market peopl game system predict made obamacar free market critic includ ibd said law mountain regul would inevit lead say obamacar fan", "title": "Now Humana May Bail On ObamaCare"}, "46": {"text": "Health Reform: ObamaCare has taken lots of hits lately, but a new congressional report is a gut punch. It shows that ObamaCare's outlook has worsened considerably as fewer people sign up and costs rise more than expected.To little fanfare and virtually no media coverage, the Congressional Budget Office sharply downgraded its forecast for ObamaCare in its latest report, issued in late March. By just about every measure, things are looking worse than they did a year ago.\u00a0First, the CBO has cut enrollment goals for the ObamaCare exchanges. Its March 2015 report projected that enrollment would top out at 22 million. Now it puts the ceiling at 18 million. And given ObamaCare's track record, even that's optimistic.Lower enrollment numbers should mean lower taxpayer costs, since fewer people will be getting taxpayer-subsidized insurance. But higher-than-expected insurance subsidies are soaking up much of those savings.Last year, CBO projected that the average subsidy would be $4,040. Turns out, it was $4,240.CBO now thinks subsidies will average $4,550 next year instead of $4,250. That is likely a reflection of the fact that premiums leapt this year and are likely to make another big jump for next year.As a result, even though the CBO expects that 4 million fewer people will be getting insurance subsidies in 2024, the total cost of those subsidies paid out that year will stay exactly the same: $99 billion.ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion is also turning out to be far more expensive than planned, forcing the CBO to hike its 10-year Medicaid cost projection by $146 billion. That's largely the result of far more people signing up for Medicaid than expected. Instead of 45 million enrolled in Medicaid this year, as the CBO had been predicting, there are 68 million.In addition, far more workers will find themselves without employer-provided benefits than promised.In its initial report on ObamaCare in 2010, CBO said 3 million workers at most would lose their employer health benefits because of the law.Last year it claimed that 7 million will have lost workplace coverage in a decade. Now it says 9 million will likely be forced off employer plans.And what about the uninsured?When Democrats shoved ObamaCare onto President Obama's desk in 2010, the public was told that it would cut the number of uninsured by 32 million. That number has since dropped 25%.Looked at another way, ObamaCare is now slated to spend $1.94 trillion over the next decade, and yet still leave 1-in-10 Americans without insurance.Oh, and the revenues from ObamaCare taxes will be lower than expected over the next decade, either because they just aren't producing as hoped, or because the White House has delayed various taxes for political reasons. CBO says the employer mandate will raise $12 billion less than it said last year, the individual mandate penalty $6 billion less and the Cadillac tax $28 billion less. (The combination of higher costs and lower revenues, by the way, means those promises about how ObamaCare would not add a dime to the deficit have also proved unreliable.)Repealing ObamaCare wouldn't mean forcing millions off insurance. What it would do is create the opportunity to enact free-market reforms that would actually deliver on ObamaCare's promise of lower costs and expanded coverage.Let's hope voters will understand this when they cast their ballots in November.", "clean_text2": "health reform obamacar taken lot hit late new congression report gut punch show obamacar outlook worsen consider fewer peopl sign cost rise expect littl fanfar virtual media coverag congression budget offic sharpli downgrad forecast obamacar latest report issu late march everi measur thing look wors year ago first cbo cut enrol goal obamacar exchang march 2015 report project enrol would top 22 million put ceil 18 million given obamacar track record even optimist lower enrol number mean lower taxpay cost sinc fewer peopl get taxpay subsid insur higher expect insur subsidi soak much save last year cbo project averag subsidi would 4 040 turn 4 240 cbo think subsidi averag 4 550 next year instead 4 250 like reflect fact premium leapt year like make anoth big jump next year result even though cbo expect 4 million fewer peopl get insur subsidi 2024 total cost subsidi paid year stay exact 99 billion obamacar medicaid expans also turn far expens plan forc cbo hike 10 year medicaid cost project 146 billion larg result far peopl sign medicaid expect instead 45 million enrol medicaid year cbo predict 68 million addit far worker find without employ provid benefit promis initi report obamacar 2010 cbo said 3 million worker would lose employ health benefit law last year claim 7 million lost workplac coverag decad say 9 million like forc employ plan uninsur democrat shove obamacar onto presid obama desk 2010 public told would cut number uninsur 32 million number sinc drop 25 look anoth way obamacar slate spend 1 94 trillion next decad yet still leav 1 10 american without insur oh revenu obamacar tax lower expect next decad either produc hope white hous delay various tax polit reason cbo say employ mandat rais 12 billion less said last year individu mandat penalti 6 billion less cadillac tax 28 billion less combin higher cost lower revenu way mean promis obamacar would add dime deficit also prove unreli repeal obamacar mean forc million insur would creat opportun enact free market reform would actual deliv obamacar promis lower cost expand coverag let hope voter understand cast ballot novemb", "byline": "", "date": "April 11, 2016 Monday", "clean_text": "health reform obamacar taken lot hit late new congression report gut punch show obamacar outlook worsen consider fewer peopl sign cost rise expect littl fanfar virtual media coverag congression budget offic sharpli downgrad forecast obamacar latest report issu late march everi measur thing look wors year ago first cbo cut enrol goal obamacar exchang march 2015 report project enrol would top 22 million put ceil 18 million given obamacar track record even optimist lower enrol number mean lower taxpay cost sinc fewer peopl get taxpay subsid insur higher expect insur subsidi soak much save last year cbo project averag subsidi would 4 040 turn 4 240 cbo think subsidi averag 4 550 next year instead 4 250 like reflect fact premium leapt year like make anoth big jump next year result even though cbo expect 4 million fewer peopl get insur subsidi 2024 total cost subsidi paid year stay exact 99 billion obamacar medicaid expans also turn far expens plan forc cbo hike 10 year medicaid cost project 146 billion larg result far peopl sign medicaid expect instead 45 million enrol medicaid year cbo predict 68 million addit far worker find without employ provid benefit promis initi report obamacar 2010 cbo said 3 million worker would lose employ health benefit law last year claim 7 million lost workplac coverag decad say 9 million like forc employ plan uninsur democrat shove obamacar onto presid obama desk 2010 public told would cut number uninsur 32 million number sinc drop 25 look anoth way obamacar slate spend 1 94 trillion next decad yet still leav 1 10 american without insur oh revenu obamacar tax lower expect next decad either produc hope white hous delay various tax polit reason cbo say employ mandat rais 12 billion less said last year individu mandat penalti 6 billion less cadillac tax 28 billion less combin higher cost lower revenu way mean promis obamacar would add dime deficit also prove unreli repeal obamacar mean forc million insur would creat opportun enact free market reform would actual deliv obamacar promis lower cost expand coverag let hope voter understand cast ballot novemb", "title": "ObamaCare Gets A Downgrade"}, "55": {"text": " Washington: Office of the Senator Lamar Alexander, U.S Government has issued the following news release:  U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander today highlighted The Tennessean's Wednesday front-page headline, which read: \"Very Near Collapse\"--words used by Tennessee's insurance commissioner to describe the state of Tennessee's Obamacare insurance exchange. Alexander said this is \"happening in states all over the country as Obamacare plans and rates get locked in for next year.\"\u00a0 Alexander said that \"Americans have a choice this election. You know exactly what Democrats will do if they are in charge. Democrats will increase Washington's control of your private health insurance choices. Democrats will spend more of your taxpayer dollars to prop up the collapsing Obamacare exchanges.\"\u00a0 Alexander contrasted this approach with what Republicans have proposed.\u00a0\u00a0 \"We want to help Americans struggling with the cost of health insurance immediately. We would do that by giving states more flexibility to give individuals and their families options to purchase lower-cost private health insurance plans outside of Obamacare,\" he said.\u00a0 Alexander pointed out that \"before Obamacare ever became law, Republicans warned President Obama and Democrats in Congress that this would happen.\u00a0 \"In February of 2010, I spoke for Republicans at a White House summit on health care and warned President Obama that premiums for millions of Americans with individual insurance would rise under his proposal.\u00a0 \"But warnings are not much use now. Americans need action.\"\u00a0 Click HERE for video of Alexander's weekly Republican address. The full text follows:\u00a0 I'm Senator Lamar Alexander, from Tennessee.\u00a0 When Tennesseans woke up on Wednesday morning and opened up our state's largest paper, the front page headline read \"Very Near Collapse.\"\u00a0 The story wasn't about a bridge or a foreign dictatorship. \"Very Near Collapse\" was our state insurance commissioner's description of the Obamacare exchange in Tennessee, which more than 230,000 Tennesseans used to buy health plans last year.\u00a0 What does \"Very Near Collapse\" mean in the real world? This November, when Tennesseans are signing up for 2017 Obamacare plans, there will be fewer plans to choose from--and they'll be much more expensive. That picture will be the same for many Americans across the country.\u00a0 Next year, Tennesseans will be paying an intolerable increase--on average between 44 and 62 percent more for their Obamacare plans than they paid last year. Even for a healthy, 40-year-old, non-smoking Tennessean with the lowest-price silver plan on Tennessee's exchange, premiums increased last year to $262 a month. Next year, it's $333 a month.\u00a0 And if you, the policyholder, don't pay all of it, then you, the taxpayer, will, because a large portion of Obamacare premiums are subsidized with tax dollars.\u00a0 Tennessee had to take extreme measures to allow these increases because insurance companies told the state if you don't let us file for rate increases, we will have to leave. If that happened, Tennesseans might have had only one insurer to choose from.\u00a0 That's what's happening in states all over the country, as Obamacare plans and rates get locked in for next year.\u00a0 According to consulting firm Avalere Health, Americans buying insurance in one-third of Obamacare exchange regions next year may have only one insurer to choose from.\u00a0 People buying on Obamacare exchanges will have only one insurer to choose from in five states next year: Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u00a0 Politico reports that one Arizona county is \"poised to become an Obamacare ghost town\" because no insurer can afford to sell health plans on the region's Obamacare exchange. This leaves 9,700 people in Pinal, Arizona, with no Obamacare plan options in 2017.\u00a0 Before Obamacare ever became law, Republicans warned President Obama and Democrats in Congress that this would happen.\u00a0 In February of 2010, I spoke for Republicans at a White House summit on health care and warned President Obama that premiums for millions of Americans with individual insurance would rise under his proposal.\u00a0 But warnings are not much use now. Americans need action.\u00a0 As Tennessee's governor said this week: \"The federal government needs to come in and address the situation. They created the program and so they're going to have to address that.\"\u00a0 In other words, the next Congress--no matter who is president--will have to deal with the mess that Obamacare is causing in our states and the pain it is causing the American people.\u00a0 Americans have a choice this election.\u00a0 You know exactly what Democrats will do if they are in charge. Democrats will increase Washington's control of your private health insurance choices. Democrats will spend more of your taxpayer dollars to prop up the collapsing Obamacare exchanges.\u00a0 Republicans have offered a better idea.\u00a0 We want to help Americans struggling with the cost of health insurance immediately. We would do that by giving states more flexibility to give individuals and their families options to purchase lower-cost private health insurance plans outside of Obamacare.\u00a0 The problem of solving Obamacare takes more than a five-minute radio address. But helping Americans struggling to buy private health insurance plans is something we ought to do immediately.\u00a0 In order to avoid a near collapse of our nation's health insurance market, we need a Republican Congress next year.\u00a0\u00a0  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com ", "clean_text2": "washington offic

the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that investigated the Affordable Care Act's CO-OP program earlier this year, announced his companion legislation to Nebraska Congressman Adrian Smith's CO-OP Consumer Protection Act. The simple legislation would repeal Obamacare's mandate for families who lost their insurance coverage when Obamacare's CO-OPs collapsed.\u00a0\u00a0 \"This is about fairness. It is unjust to make families who suffered because of the incompetence of Obamacare's bureaucrats pay Obamacare's mandate. More than a hundred thousand Nebraskans and Iowans lost their health insurance when CoOportunity failed and that was just the beginning -- more than half of Obamacare's CO-OPs have collapsed across the country. While the entirety of Obamacare must be repealed, Republicans and Democrats should be able to at least agree that it is callous to force CO-OP victims to pay Obamacare's individual mandate penalty. I'm grateful for Congressman Smith's work in the House and I'm proud to join that effort by introducing this bill in the Senate.\"\u00a0 Background:\u00a0 Sasse will introduce the Senate companion to the CO-OP Consumer Protection Act early next week. This legislation repeals Obamacare's individual mandate for anyone who purchased insurance from one Obamacare's failed CO-OPs. The bill applies retroactively to the Nebraskans and Iowans who lost their coverage when CoOportunity failed.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and six other colleagues Wednesday in introducing the State Flexibility to Provide Affordable Health Options Act, legislation that would give states the ability to help their residents who are faced with significant premium increases and limited options on Obamacare exchanges.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I have worked for years to limit the damage and harm done to real people by Obamacare, a partisan policy that promised marketplace competition and higher quality health plans at lower costs and instead delivered the exact opposite,\" Sen. Johnson said. \"This bill would provide necessary relief to Wisconsinites who, under Obamacare, would be penalized for not purchasing a product that they cannot afford or does not meet their needs. It will allow the state to provide Wisconsinites receiving subsidies more options than just those offered on the Obamacare exchanges for 2017.\"\u00a0 While this bill would only apply for plan year 2017 as a temporary step while work continues on efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare with more successful reforms, it would be a significant step to free Americans who are currently suffering the serious negative consequences of Obamacare. It would give states with failing Obamacare exchanges the authority to allow residents to purchase plans outside of the exchanges, even with subsidies. Residents in states that elect to do so will not be subject to the individual mandate.  \u00a0 Projections for 2017 include premiums rising by double-digit percentages and more limited options under Obamacare. Over 30 percent of U.S. counties are expected to have just one insurer offering plans on Obamacare exchanges; four counties in Wisconsin are expected to only have one insurer, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Despite increasing costs and decreasing competition, Americans and Wisconsinites are being forced either to purchase a product that they do not want and cannot afford to use -- or to face a tax penalty.\u00a0 The legislation, introduced by Sens. Ron Johnson, Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), David Perdue (R-Ga.), and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), would:\u00a0     Give states with a failing Obamacare exchange the authority to allow residents to use their Obamacare subsidy to purchase any health plan of their choice, even those off the exchange, for the 2017 plan year.     If the state chooses to use this authority to allow residents to use subsidies outside of the exchange, the legislation will waive the Obamacare law's requirement that you must buy a specific health care plan or pay a fine of as much as $2,000 for a family of four next year.\u00a0  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com ", "clean_text2": "washington offic senat ron johnson issu follow news releas sen ron johnson r wis join sen lamar alexand r tenn six colleagu wednesday introduc state flexibl provid afford health option act legisl would give state abil help resid face signific premium increas limit option obamacar exchang work year limit damag harm done real peopl obamacar partisan polici promis marketplac competit higher qualiti health plan lower cost instead deliv exact opposit sen johnson said bill would provid necessari relief wisconsinit obamacar would penal purchas product afford meet need allow state provid wisconsinit receiv subsidi option offer obamacar exchang 2017 bill would appli plan year 2017 temporari step work continu effort repeal replac obamacar success reform would signific step free american current suffer serious negat consequ obamacar would give state fail obamacar exchang author allow resid purchas plan outsid exchang even subsidi resid state elect subject individu mandat project 2017 includ premium rise doubl digit percentag limit option obamacar 30 percent u counti expect one insur offer plan obamacar exchang four counti wisconsin expect one insur accord kaiser famili foundat despit increas cost decreas competit american wisconsinit forc either purchas product want afford use face tax penalti legisl introduc sen ron johnson lamar alexand r tenn kelli ayott r n h john barrasso r wyo thad cochran r miss mark kirk r ill david perdu r ga rob portman r ohio would give state fail obamacar exchang author allow resid use obamacar subsidi purchas health plan choic even exchang 2017 plan year state choos use author allow resid use subsidi outsid exchang legisl waiv obamacar law requir must buy specif health care plan pay fine much 2 000 famili four next year case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "byline": "", "date": "September 14, 2016 Wednesday", "clean_text": "washington offic senat ron johnson issu follow news releas sen ron johnson r wis join sen lamar alexand r tenn six colleagu wednesday introduc state flexibl provid afford health option act legisl would give state abil help resid face signific premium increas limit option obamacar exchang work year limit damag harm done real peopl obamacar partisan polici promis marketplac competit higher qualiti health plan lower cost instead deliv exact opposit sen johnson said bill would provid necessari relief wisconsinit obamacar would penal purchas product afford meet need allow state provid wisconsinit receiv subsidi option offer obamacar exchang 2017 bill would appli plan year 2017 temporari step work continu effort repeal replac obamacar success reform would signific step free american current suffer serious negat consequ obamacar would give state fail obamacar exchang author allow resid purchas plan outsid exchang even subsidi resid state elect subject individu mandat project 2017 includ premium rise doubl digit percentag limit option obamacar 30 percent u counti expect one insur offer plan obamacar exchang four counti wisconsin expect one insur accord kaiser famili foundat despit increas cost decreas competit american wisconsinit forc either purchas product want afford use face tax penalti legisl introduc sen ron johnson lamar alexand r tenn kelli ayott r n h john barrasso r wyo thad cochran r miss mark kirk r ill david perdu r ga rob portman r ohio would give state fail obamacar exchang author allow resid use obamacar subsidi purchas health plan choic even exchang 2017 plan year state choos use author allow resid use subsidi outsid exchang legisl waiv obamacar law requir must buy specif health care plan pay fine much 2 000 famili four next year case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "title": "Washington: Johnson Introduces Emergency, One-Year Legislation Allowing Wisconsin to Offer More Health Insurance Options Next Year"}, "9": {"text": "Health Reform: ObamaCare was supposed to make the health care system more efficient and less expensive. Yet it has flushed tens of billions of dollars down the drain before providing anyone affordable coverage.The Obama administration plans several events this week to mark the 6 th anniversary of President Obama's signing ObamaCare into law on March 23, with lots of happy talk about gains in coverage and low inflation.One thing you won't hear about is the massive amounts of waste involved in setting the law up. That story has been told in dribs and drabs over the past six years, so it's easy to forget how much was involved. So as an ObamaCare birthday present to taxpayers, we decided to add up the big-ticket items.\u00a0VInsurance Co-Ops: So far, 12 of 23 non-profit insurance co-ops established by ObamaCare have failed. It's becoming increasingly unlikely that they will ever pay back the $1.2 billion in startup loans they got from taxpayers. With several more co-ops in terrible financial straits, that price tag could easily climb. Overall, ObamaCare shoveled $2.4 billion into these ill-conceived co-ops.VState-run exchanges: ObamaCare awarded a total of more than $5 billion in grants for states to set up state-run exchanges. About $729 million went to dozens of states that decided against building an exchange; $778 million went to exchanges that have since failed -- which means $1.5 billion was simply flushed down the drain. How much of the remaining grant money was wasted is unclear, but a Government Accountability Office audit last fall did find that not one of the remaining 14 state-run exchanges is fully functional.VHealthcare.gov: After spending more than $2 billion to construct Healthcare.gov, it failed at launch and is still unfinished. Although it was supposed to be self-financed, Obama wants an additional $535 million to keep it running next year.VInsurance bailouts: This year, the Obama administration announced that it was diverting $3.5 billion meant for the Treasury to insurance companies to help cover losses suffered from ObamaCare. Republicans think this might be illegal, but in any case, it's money that wouldn't have been spent if not for ObamaCare.VImproper subsidies: A report from the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee found that by June 2015, ObamaCare had handed out $750 million in subsidies to more than half a million people who weren't eligible for coverage when they couldn't verify their citizenship status.VIRS costs: Because ObamaCare relies so heavily on the IRS to implement its massively complicated insurance subsidy scheme and insurance mandate penalties, the IRS had to spend $881 million to get systems and personnel in place to handle the job.VPaperwork burdens: An analysis by the American Action Forum concluded that businesses and individuals have spent 165 million hours to comply with ObamaCare's 106 new regulations. In dollar terms, that works out to $45 billion.Add it all up and it comes out to $55 billion. And that's being generous to ObamaCare. This figure doesn't count what families forced off health plans they liked had to pay in to buy ObamaCare's overpriced insurance. Or the adverse impact ObamaCare has had on the labor market. Nor does it count the vast amounts of waste and fraud in Medicaid before ObamaCare vastly expanded eligibility.Yes, it is true that ObamaCare has expanded insurance coverage. But when you consider the vast amount of waste and inefficiency it has added to health care, to say nothing of the enormous costs of its Rube Goldberg subsidy scheme, there is no question that the country could have achieved those gains at far less expense.The only thing to celebrate about ObamaCare's 6 th anniversary is that -- God willing -- it will be its last.", "clean_text2": "health

This is why despite five years of promotion by the White House 52 percent still oppose the law.\u00a0\u00a0 Recent reports indicate stalled enrollment growth, skyrocketing premiums, and major insurers having \"serious concerns\" about the law's \"sustainability.\" To put it simply, Obamacare is crumbling before our eyes:\u00a0     Obamacare Regulations Will Cost Businesses And Individuals More Than $45 Billion: \"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law nearly six years ago.

Furthermore, the CBO implied that it expects exchange enrollment to peak at 16 million: a far cry from the 24 million it predicted last March.\" (Forbes, 1/26/16)\u00a0     Average Obamacare Premium Rises To $408 Per Month: \"The average ObamaCare premium rose to $408 per month for 2016 plans, about a 9 percent increase from this time last year, according to a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services.\" (The Hill, 1/21/16)\u00a0     Obamacare Will Cost US Economy Equivalent of 2 Million Jobs: \"ObamaCare will force a reduction in American work hours &mdash; the equivalent of 2 million jobs over the next decade.&hellip;The total workforce will shrink by just under 1 percent as a result of changes in worker participation because of the new coverage expansions, mandates and changes in tax rates, according to a 22-page report released by the Congressional Budget Office.\" (The Hill, 12/7/15)\u00a0     UnitedHealth Expects To Lose Nearly $1 Billion On Obamacare: \"UnitedHealth expects to lose nearly $1 billion on Obamacare policies, the nation's largest insurer said Tuesday.

Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said on a call Monday while discussing the company's fourth-quarter results. 'We remain concerned about the overall stability of the risk pool.'\" (Bloomberg, 2/1/16)\u00a0 The abject failure of this law is why House Republicans remain committed to getting rid of Obamacare. We sent a bill repealing Obamacare to the President's desk even when Democrats did everything possible to stop us.

affordability, affordability. That's the priority.\"\u00a0That was Ron Pollack, president of Families USA -- which was one of the loudest proponents of Obamacare and which got paid $1 million in 2013 to produce pro-ObamaCare propaganda -- at a press event in Philadelphia this week\u00a0about what needs to come next on health reform.Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress -- another vociferous ObamaCare champion -- echoed Pollack's sentiments at the same meeting, saying that tackling health care costs is \"the next generation of health care reform.\"\u00a0These advocacy groups are just echoing what Hillary Clinton promises will be a priority should she win the White House. \"It is finally time for us to deal with the skyrocketing out-of-pocket health costs,\" she has said.But wait, wasn't ObamaCare itself supposed to fix the affordability problem?Its official name is, after all, the \"Affordable Care Act.\" And didn't President Obama repeatedly promise that affordability is what this law would deliver?Why, yes, he did. \"Once this reform is implemented, health insurance exchanges will be created, a competitive marketplace where uninsured people and small businesses will finally be able to purchase affordable, quality insurance,\" Obama said on the day he signed ObamaCare into law.So if affordability is such a huge problem today, then what is the $1.9 trillion ObamaCare will spend over the next decade on insurance subsidies and expanded Medicaid for?It is true that\u00a0ObamaCare's subsidies and expanded eligibility for Medicaid has lowered insurance costs for those who are eligible. But for the majority of middle class families who don't quality for those subsidies, ObamaCare has provided no relief at all. Instead, they are seeing double-digit premium hikes year after year for plans that impose huge deductibles while strictly limiting their choice of doctors and hospitals.A 2014 study by the liberal Brookings Institution found that ObamaCare boosted premiums in the individual market in its first year by more than 24%. This year, insurers are asking for hikes that range to upward of 60%.Democrats in Philadelphia also repeatedly pushed for a \"public option\" -- which would be a government-run health plan that would compete with private plans in the ObamaCare exchanges.This is nothing more than an admission that Obama's promise of \"a competitive marketplace\" has failed as well.In fact, two-thirds of the ObamaCare-created nonprofit co-ops have already gone bankrupt -- taking with them close to $2 billion in taxpayer loans -- and major insurers are pulling out of ObamaCare markets after losing truckloads of money.Competition, in other words, is dwindling, not thriving, to the point where Democrats now fear that some markets will end up bereft of insurance choices altogether. That's why Democrats are desperate to revive the same \"public option\" idea they rejected six years ago when they shoved ObamaCare down the country's throat.Indeed, the only Democrat in Philadelphia who seems oblivious to ObamaCare's failures is Obama. And all he could bring himself to say is that \"we declared that health care in America\u00a0is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody.\"Yet while Democrats in Philadelphia admit failure, their solution amounts to more of the same: More government regulation, more taxpayer subsidies, less free market competition.Anyone who thinks that\u00a0additional doses of the same poison will fix what's wrong with the nation's health care system needs to have their heads examined.", "clean_text2": "http www investor com wp content upload 2016 07 edit5 obamacar 072816 newscom jpg afford afford afford prioriti ron pollack presid famili usa one loudest propon obamacar got paid 1 million 2013 produc pro obamacar propaganda press event philadelphia week need come next health reform neera tanden presid center american progress anoth vocifer obamacar champion echo pollack sentiment meet say tackl health care cost next generat health care reform advocaci group echo hillari clinton promis prioriti win white hous final time us deal skyrocket pocket health cost said wait obamacar suppos fix afford problem offici name afford care act presid obama repeat promis afford law would deliv yes reform implement health insur exchang creat competit marketplac uninsur peopl small busi final abl purchas afford qualiti insur obama said day sign obamacar law afford huge problem today 1 9 trillion obamacar spend next decad insur subsidi expand medicaid true obamacar subsidi expand elig medicaid lower insur cost elig major middl class famili qualiti subsidi obamacar provid relief instead see doubl digit premium hike year year plan impos huge deduct strict limit choic doctor hospit 2014 studi liber brook institut found obamacar boost premium individu market first year 24 year insur ask hike rang upward 60 democrat philadelphia also repeat push public option would govern run health plan would compet privat plan obamacar exchang noth admiss obama promis competit marketplac fail well fact two third obamacar creat nonprofit co op alreadi gone bankrupt take close 2 billion taxpay loan major insur pull obamacar market lose truckload money competit word dwindl thrive point democrat fear market end bereft insur choic altogeth democrat desper reviv public option idea reject six year ago shove obamacar countri throat inde democrat philadelphia seem oblivi obamacar failur obama could bring say declar health care america privileg right everybodi yet democrat philadelphia admit failur solut amount govern regul taxpay subsidi less free market competit anyon think addit dose poison fix wrong nation health care system need head examin", "byline": "NC Nunn Scott;

This is the first Obamacare repeal bill that made it to the president's desk since the law's enactment in 2010. President Barack Obama vetoed H.R. 3762 on January 8, 2016.  Last year, Congress passed a balanced budget agreement which allows for a reconciliation bill to proceed. This is a budget mechanism that can only be used once every year. In the Senate, such a bill is filibuster proof and requires only a simple majority to pass. In December, the repeal bill passed the Senate by a 52-47 vote.

The simple legislation would repeal Obamacare's mandate for families who lost their insurance coverage when Obamacare's CO-OPs collapsed.\u00a0\u00a0 \"This is about fairness. It is unjust to make families who suffered because of the incompetence of Obamacare's bureaucrats pay Obamacare's mandate. More than a hundred thousand Nebraskans and Iowans lost their health insurance when CoOportunity failed and that was just the beginning -- more than half of Obamacare's CO-OPs have collapsed across the country.

less choice for health insurance.\u00a0\u00a0 Excerpts of Senator Barrasso's remarks:\u00a0 \"I can still remember the president back in 2009, when he gave his speech to Congress, he said, 'In 34 states, 75 percent of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies.'\u00a0 \"The president said that 'without competition, the price of insurance goes up,' and he said that 'quality goes down.'\u00a0 \"That's what President Obama said seven years ago. He said that five options or fewer was such a threat to competition and to quality of care for American families that he needed to create his very own entire Obamacare system.\u00a0 \"So what's the situation today?

Washington: Office of the Senator John McCain has issued the following news release:  U.S. Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Ron Johnson (R-WI) and John Barrasso (R-WY) today introduced the Protection from Obamacare Monopolies Act, legislation that would protect all individuals who live in a county with one or no health insurers offering plans on the Obamacare exchanges from the individual mandate penalty.\u00a0\u00a0 Arizona has been hit particularly hard by providers fleeing the federal marketplace after incurring unsustainable financial losses over the last several years. Pinal County, Arizona recently became the first county in America to be left without a single provider in the Obamacare marketplace. Nearly all of Arizona's counties currently have just one health care provider offering health care plans in the exchanges. Last week, Maricopa County, Arizona - the most populous county in the state - became the latest to be left with only one provider in the Obamacare exchanges after Phoenix Health Plans, Inc. announced it would leave the exchanges. This trend is true across the country. According to Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurance company offering health care plans in the Obamacare marketplace.\u00a0 \"With Phoenix Health Plans, Inc.'s exit from the Obamacare marketplace last week, nearly all of Arizona's counties are now left with either one or no options when it comes to health insurance under Obamacare,\" said Senator McCain. \"This legislation would ensure that Arizonans are not forced to pay a penalty due to the failure of a healthcare system that was fatally flawed from conception. This failed law will only continue to place undue burdens on Arizona families unless we replace it with solutions that put patients back in charge of their health care.\"\u00a0 \"Obamacare is an unmitigated disaster in Arizona,\" said Senator Flake. \"The exchanges for 13 of the state's 15 counties are devoid of competition because they are left with only a single insurer willing to sell coverage. Another county's exchange has the dubious distinction of being the first in the nation to be completely abandoned by providers. As the administration continues to defend this failed law, we will not wait around for them to fix its mess, which is why we have introduced this legislation to help protect those in Arizona and across the country from unjustifiable financial penalties when they are left without healthcare options.\"\u00a0 \"Instead of lowering costs, Obamacare has made things worse: insurance companies across the country are fleeing the exchange market at an alarming rate, premiums have skyrocketed, and networks have become more narrow. Obamacare is in a death spiral. What's worse, Obamacare will impose a fine on countless individuals who no longer have affordable insurance options in their county,\" said Senator Cotton. \"Hard-working Americans shouldn't face more taxes because President Obama's Obamacare hopes and dreams failed. This bill will provide much needed relief from the Obamacare Mandate penalty and allow Americans to purchase coverage they can afford and that actually meets their healthcare needs.\u00a0 \"As Obamacare continues to crumble, here's the administration's cruel choice for millions of Americans next year: pay Washington's mandate or bite the bullet and pay the only insurance company available on the exchange in your county,\" said Senator Sasse. \"Our simple legislation spares moms and dads from Obamacare's raw deal. For months we've sounded the alarm about Obamacare's lousy choices and unaffordable prices--this whole mess must be repealed but, if Democrats keep trying to defend the indefensible, we should at least help those who are hurt the most.\"\u00a0 \"The definition of 'marketplace' is an economic system in which companies compete with each other to sell their products. It leads to lower prices, higher quality, and a higher level of customer service,\" said Senator Johnson. \"The Obamacare definition of marketplace, by contrast, has resulted in a failed government system that reduces competition and its benefits. Under Obamacare, Wisconsinites can be penalized for not buying a company's product, even when there is only one company selling it. This legislation would help ensure that Wisconsin families won't have to pay a penalty to help cover the cost of Obamacare's failed promise of consumer choice.\"\u00a0 \"A majority of Americans have two or fewer options on the Obamacare exchanges, and 31 percent have only one option,\" said Senator Barrasso. \"When there's only one option, that's not a marketplace, it's a monopoly. This bill provides desperately needed relief for those who are hit the hardest.\"\u00a0 Last week, Senator McCain sent a letter asking the Obama Administration how it planned to address the coverage gap that citizens of Pinal County may experience next year as a result of Aetna's recent decision to pull out of the Obamacare marketplace.\u00a0 Senator McCain has also introduced legislation that would fully repeal and replace Obamacare with affordable and accessible solutions that put patients back in charge of their health care decisions.

COLLAPSE"}, "92": {"text": "Docs for ObamacareRe \"How to replace Obamacare,\" Opinion, June 13Dr. Joel Strom, a dentist, has proposed another misguided Republican effort to replace the Affordable Care Act.Republican alternatives tend to strip away benefits as they strip away cost controls and are thus inherently unworkable. Obamacare's flaws are the result of the political maneuvering that was required to get the legislation passed. We should either fix Obamacare or replace it with the far more efficient single-payer system.Strom wants physician organizations to jump on board with a plan in Congress to replace Obamacare by providing $2,500 to each American adult to buy insurance. He shouldn't be surprised when they don't endorse yet another bad Republican idea.David Hurwitz, MD\u00a0Calabasas::If the Republican Party really wants to speak with \"clarity, sincerity and authority\" on healthcare, as suggested by Strom, it might start with a frank discussion of the finances of the proposal from Rep. Pete Sessions from Texas and Sen. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana that he promotes.That plan would deprive millions of Americans their current Obamacare coverage in return for a $2,500 payment that pays two adults about a quarter of the estimated $20,000 annual health insurance premium for a family of four.This illusory \"greater choice\" is as meaningful as a choice offered to both rich and poor to sleep under a bridge.Daniel J. Stone, MDBeverly Hills::I read with interest Strom's piece in The Times. It will be difficult for the GOP to convince people that it actually cares about patients when 19 states, all because of decisions by GOP lawmakers, have declined money offered to them by the federal government to expand Medicaid.Strom asserts that Obamacare may be inefficient in some areas, but it seems that inefficient insurance for the poor is better than no insurance at all.Good luck, Dr. Strom, convincing the American people that the GOP cares at all about medical patients.Thomas MathewsVentura--Obama should say 'radical Islam'Re \" 'Magic words' for terrorism,\" editorial, June 15I disagree with The Times' belief that President Obama's refusal to utter the words \"radical Islam\" is a non-issue.The president is restrained by a lack of trust in the American people. This became clear early on when he began to lecture us, talk down to us and deride those who regard Islamist killers as more than workplace violence.This is why he will not call Islamist terror Islamist terror; he does not trust that we can distinguish between murderous jihadists clinging to a medieval interpretation of Islam and normative practitioners of modern Islam. He does not realize how this debases the public square and diminishes confidence in his leadership.It escapes his notice that this is the soft bigotry of low expectations directed at the very people who chose him to lead.Paul BlousteinCincinnati::Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, a descendent of immigrants and a man who wants to be the president of a nation of immigrants, said about the Orlando mass killer, \"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.\"I dare Trump to hold this same standard to mass murderers like Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and say he was in America only because we allowed the Irish to come here.Once again, Trump has revealed his true colors: He is a racist and a bigot who selects by race and religion the morally acceptable Americans, and if they fail to meet his standard and are American citizens, he will blame their families or ancestors.Trump is morally bankrupt, and the Republican Party should be ashamed to claim him as its nominee.Sidney MorrisonLos Angeles::Republicans are lambasting Obama and Hillary for not using the term \"radical Islam.\"What about that organization of men down south wearing crosses on their chest? They are the Ku Klux Klan. We don't call them \"radical Christians.\" Those among them who kill, we call killers.Do we call priests who molest children \"Catholic pedophiles?\" No, we call them pedophiles.These terrorists are just terrorists, and any attempt to equate their crimes to their religion makes as much sense as my examples above.Robert S. HenrySan Gabriel--A foster child's best interestRe \"Custody case under scrutiny,\" June 11So a little girl in foster care was in a \"temporary\" home for four years? As a clinical social worker and child therapist for 30 years, I can say unequivocally that almost 70% of a child's life, spent in one loving and devoted family, is not temporary -- at least not to the child.Attachment theory and common sense tell us that although it is perhaps sad that the Department of Children and Family Services took this long to find and secure a home with Choctaw relatives (the 6-year-old girl is 1/64 Chocktaw), the family and emotional bond was already well established with her foster parents.It is not credible that this child is \"doing well,\" as suggested in the article. She belongs with her true family --those with whom she has a psychological bond and emotional attachment.Gina AdelmanLos Angeles::Six years old and 1/64 Chocktow? This warrants her being pulled out of a loving home where she has lived for four years? To be placed with extended family in a non-Chocktow household in Utah?Are there no exceptions to the rules of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act? If the child wasn't 1/64 Chocktow, she wouldn't have to move to Utah as there would be no issue.Whatever happened to doing what's in the best interest of the child?Georgette RieckSanta Monica--Profiting from brain injuryRe \"Should boxing be KO'd?\" column, June 13Dad was glued to the TV watching the Thursday night fights. Maybe he felt like the underdog.When in Rome I visited the Coliseum and wondered who was the animal. Man is driven by competition and profit. For example, war creates jobs and benefits corporate America. New San Diego and Los Angeles football stadiums will provide more private boxes for wealthy attendees at taxpayer expense, yet considering the injury risks of the sport, a plan like this is brain dead.Would capitalism collapse if men refused to kill or injure each other on the battlefield, on the football field or in the boxing ring? Maybe it's time to think new. When I think about it, I can only conclude that the brain is too valuable to be beaten to a pulp.Roger NewellSan Diego::The best tribute and memorial to Muhammad Ali, the late boxing champion, would be to outlaw professional boxing.This is a brutal public spectacle in which two athletes fight to inflict a disabling brain concussion, called a \"knock out,\" on each other. It may have caused Ali the loss of his health for nearly half his life and hastened his death at the age of 74.Ricardo NicolSan Clemente--For Bernie, against HillaryRe \"Guide to party unity written in 2008,\" June 11Count me out on switching to supporting Hillary Clinton for president.Anyone for Sen. Bernie Sanders is truly for economic and environmental reform so desperately needed to save our nation and the world. Clinton's ascendency guarantees a snarky, catastrophic end to hope for these essential changes as she funnels more money away from the vanishing middle classes and working people into military ambitions.Since I first voted in 1972, there has never been a truly progressive option for the presidency, and I won't vote for the lesser of two destructive candidates again. How did President Obama follow through on his promises to end overseas wars and close the prison at Guantanamo Bay? Moreover, he has overseen our nation's largest shift to a spying police state.I voted for the black male George W. Bush in 2008, but I won't vote for the white female Bush in 2016.

families and businesses will continue to experience the effects of the President's broken promises for his domestic policy achievement, Obamacare.\u00a0\u00a0 According to Gallup's latest poll, American families cite the cost of health care as their top financial concern, and with the Obamacare's well-documented failings in 2016, such as the many mismanaged health insurance co-ops and disappointingly low enrollment numbers, it's easy to understand why.\u00a0 Unfortunately, Americans in search of relief from high costs will find nothing to ease their burden under Obamacare. Instead, the status quo advocated by the Obama Administration will strap them with higher premiums.\u00a0 What's worse, they will also have less choice.  Over the last few years, insurers in many states have abandoned the poorly managed Obamacare exchanges.\u00a0 Recent headlines and polls tell the story of the health law's continued failures and highlight the need for patient-centered reforms to drive down costs and provide better access to quality care for all Americans.\u00a0 Here's a look at more disastrous Obamacare headlines:\u00a0 Associated Press: Significant premium hikes expected under Obama health law\u00a0 \"&hellip;they're setting the stage for 2017 hikes that in some cases could reach well into the double digits...\"  (April 28, 2016)\u00a0 The New York Times: News About Obamacare Has Been Bad Lately.

billions of taxpayer dollars loaned to health insurance co-ops.Todays hearing is about the families who lost their health care plans, its about the taxpayers who were swindled, its about the bureaucrats who mismanaged this program, and its about the local governments who had to cut budgets from firefighters and schools to make up for Washingtons failures, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said.\u00a0During the hearing, held by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations within the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, senators paid particular attention to the 12 of 23 Obamacare co-ops that have failed.The Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, created consumer-oriented and operated plans (co-ops) as a public option for health care. The Department of Health and Human Services awarded $2.4 billion of taxpayer money in the form of startup and solvency loans to the 23 nonprofit co-ops.Kevin Counihan, CEO of HealthCare.gov, the governments online health insurance exchange set up by Obamacare, also testified during the hearing. Counihan, deputy director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees Obamacare, told the subcommittee: The team at CMS has the charge to specifically oversee the federal loans made to these startups with the goal of maximizing the return to taxpayer funds, supporting the co-ops so that consumers have access to uninterrupted, competitive insurance coverage, and providing information to state departments of insurance so they can make the best possible decisions about the future of the co-ops in their state.When questioned, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said its too early to say whether co-ops will repay any of the taxpayer-backed loans.These failed co-ops were a costly experiment gone wrong, and real people got hurt, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said.Portman added: Over the last nine months, our subcommittee has carefully investigated these failures. We wanted to know whether HHS, when it played the role of investor, made good or bad decisions with taxpayer money. Unfortunately, what we found out is that a lot of bad decisions were made.When co-ops collapsed, 740,000 residents of 14 states lost their health insurance provider. The 12 failed co-ops also received a total of $1.2 billion in taxpayer dollars that they may never repay. 2016 Legal Monitor Worldwide.", "clean_text2": "top obamacar offici told senat panel cant guarante govern ever recov billion taxpay dollar loan health insur co op today hear famili lost health care plan taxpay swindl bureaucrat mismanag program local govern cut budget firefight school make washington failur sen ben sass r neb said hear held perman subcommitte investig within senat homeland secur government affair committe senat paid particular attent 12 23 obamacar co op fail afford care act popular known obamacar creat consum orient oper plan co op public option health care depart health human servic award 2 4 billion taxpay money form startup solvenc loan 23 nonprofit co op kevin counihan ceo healthcar gov govern onlin health insur exchang set obamacar also testifi hear counihan deputi director center medicar medicaid servic overse obamacar told subcommitte team cms charg specif overse feder loan made startup goal maxim return taxpay fund support co op consum access uninterrupt competit insur coverag provid inform state depart insur make best possibl decis futur co op state question andi slavitt act administr center medicar medicaid servic said earli say whether co op repay taxpay back loan fail co op cost experi gone wrong real peopl got hurt sen rob portman r ohio chairman perman subcommitte investig said portman ad last nine month subcommitte care investig failur want know whether hhs play role investor made good bad decis taxpay money unfortun found lot bad decis made co op collaps 740 000 resid 14 state lost health insur provid 12 fail co op also receiv total 1 2 billion taxpay dollar may never repay 2016 legal monitor worldwid", "byline": "", "date": "March 16, 2016 Wednesday", "clean_text": "top obamacar offici told senat panel cant guarante govern ever recov billion taxpay dollar loan health insur co op today hear famili lost health care plan taxpay swindl bureaucrat mismanag program local govern cut budget firefight school make washington failur sen ben sass r neb said hear held perman subcommitte investig within senat homeland secur government affair committe senat paid particular attent 12 23 obamacar co op fail afford care act popular known obamacar creat consum orient oper plan co op public option health care depart health human servic award 2 4 billion taxpay money form startup solvenc loan 23 nonprofit co op kevin counihan ceo healthcar gov govern onlin health insur exchang set obamacar also testifi hear counihan deputi director center medicar medicaid servic overse obamacar told subcommitte team cms charg specif overse feder loan made startup goal maxim return taxpay fund support co op consum access uninterrupt competit insur coverag provid inform state depart insur make best possibl decis futur co op state question andi slavitt act administr center medicar medicaid servic said earli say whether co op repay taxpay back loan fail co op cost experi gone wrong real peopl got hurt sen rob portman r ohio chairman perman subcommitte investig said portman ad last nine month subcommitte care investig failur want know whether hhs play role investor made good bad decis taxpay money unfortun found lot bad decis made co op collaps 740 000 resid 14 state lost health insur provid 12 fail co op also receiv total 1 2 billion taxpay dollar may never repay 2016 legal monitor worldwid", "title": "Federals Overlooked Cautionary Symbols of Obamacare Co-Op Flops"}, "2": {"text": "The congressional vote last month to fund the government through September, while extending some special-interest tax breaks and introducing some new ones, was the first time a majority of Republicans voted in favor of Obamacare. It looks like Congress' alternative to Obamacare is deficit-financed Obamacare.While failing to cut one penny of Obamacare spending, the so-called \"taxibus\" (tax extenders plus omnibus spending) cut almost $40 billion in Obamacare tax revenue by \"temporarily\" delaying three taxes for a year or two: the medical device excise tax, the health insurance fee and the excise tax on high-cost employer benefit plans.\u00a0Make no mistake: all three taxes are harmful and should be eliminated. However, just kicking them down the road without making any effort to cut Obamacare spending does nothing to repeal the Affordable Care Act.A two-year moratorium on the 2.3 percent medical-device excise tax will reduce revenue by almost $4 billion but, when activated, the tax will increase health care costs and divert money to the government from job creation and research-and-development. Further, the tax discriminates against one industry.The pharmaceutical industry has an Obamacare excise tax, too. However, the industry accepted it in exchange for freedom from government price controls. When Hillary Clinton talks about controlling pharmaceutical prices, she's proposing to renege on that agreement.Congress's one-year moratorium on the fee on all employer-based health insurance will reduce tax revenue by about $12 billion. However, this money was designed to go right back to health insurers as credits, which reduce net premiums paid by individuals in Obamacare's exchanges. Delaying this fee earned praise from employer groups.Nevertheless, now that insurers are guaranteed Obamacare-exchange credits, while getting relief from employers' complaints about the excise tax, there is no special interest to lobby to fix the broken Obamacare exchanges, in which 10 million people are trapped in policies with increasing costs and reduced care.The excise tax on high-cost \"Cadillac\" health plans is a little different from the other taxes. Delaying it a couple of years will reduce tax revenue by about $20 billion. Although a bad tax, it tries to solve a real problem. Pre-Obamacare, no matter how much firms spent on employees' health benefits, the value was excluded from their taxable income. This led to over-insurance, artificially high health care spending and higher income tax rates. Many proposed replacements for Obamacare would limit that open-ended exclusion with a standard deduction. The Cadillac tax should not be punted without some effort at such a reform.Usually, a Congress that claims to be fiscally responsible compromises on an appropriations bill to win a big-spending president's approval. Not this time: Congress had to fight the president to win deficit funding for Obamacare.Originally these taxes were loaded onto Obamacare to paint a veneer of budget neutrality, and President Obama wants to maintain that appearance. It is the current Congress, not the president, that prefers to sugar-coat Obamacare with deficit spending.Congress made not the slightest effort to match these tax delays with reduced spending. It could have. For example, repealing the individual mandate would reduce the deficit because many fewer people would buy coverage largely financed by credits paid to insurers in Obamacare exchanges. That would save Uncle Sam big bucks.People who fantasize that these tax cuts alone are a down payment toward replacing Obamacare should be more mindful of how other deficit-funded entitlements have grown despite politicians' perpetual promises of reform. Obamacare now joins Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security on this growing pile of unfunded liabilities.John R.

Senate floor today regarding the failures of Obamacare:\u00a0 \"Last week, Senators came to the floor to highlight the continuing broken promises of Obamacare. We did so in the shadow of proposed double-digit Obamacare premium increases in states across the country, everywhere from Tennessee to Oregon to New Hampshire.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Americans have gotten further bad news since, including Obamacare premium spikes that could reach as high as 83% in New Mexico. And each day seems to bring more and more troubling news, which could mean heartbreak for even more Americans.\u00a0 \"Take for instance some headlines from last night, 'Most Arkansas insurers propose double-digit hikes for 2017' and 'Some rates in Georgia insurance exchange could soar in 2017' &mdash; and by soar they're talking as high as 65%.\u00a0 \"As one paper put it, there is 'no end in sight for higher Obamacare premiums.' These are not just abstract numbers. They can represent real pain for families already stretched to the limits under the Obama economy.\u00a0 \"A recent survey showed that health care costs are now the top financial concern facing American families, ahead of concerns about low wages and even job loss.\u00a0 \"And what does the Democrat response too often seem to boil down to? Get over it.\u00a0 \"Just the other day the Democratic Leader in the Senate said that Americans who, like us, disagree with the pain Obamacare is causing need to just 'get over it and accept the fact that Obamacare is here to stay.'\u00a0 \"It's hardly the only callous com ent we've heard from across the aisle on Obamacare.\u00a0 \"I ask Democratic colleagues to listen to the Americans who continue to share heartbreaking Obamacare stories with us, like these Kentuckians.\u00a0 \"Should the Elizabethtown man who says he can't afford to see a doctor under his Obamacare plan &ndash; despite the fact that he pays more for his premium than his house payment &mdash; just get over it?\u00a0 \"Should the dad from Owensboro who said he's seen his family's health costs increase by nearly 250% under Obamacare just get over it? 'What happened to being rewarded for working hard in America?' this Dad asked, 'What happened to the American dream?'\u00a0 \"Many Americans are wondering the same thing. Obamacare continues to write a record of broken promises at the expense of the American people.\u00a0 \"Instead of lowering premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family as then-Senator Obama talked about on the campaign trail, Obamacare has raised many families' rates.\u00a0 \"Instead of making health care costs more affordable for all, Obamacare has led to unaffordable out-of-pocket costs for families across the country.\u00a0 \"The bottom line is this.

Pipes Last week marked Obamacare's sixth birthday. President Obama is, of course, celebrating the occasion. At a recent speech in Milwaukee, the president offered a catalog of the law's supposed successes. Unfortunately, not one of his boasts stands up to scrutiny. He's ignored the growing pile of evidence that his namesake is failing the American people. Take his biggest boast - that Obamacare has helped 20 million people gain coverage over the past six years. Arriving at that number takes some fuzzy math.\u00a0 Enrollment in Obamacare's exchanges is way below forecasts. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that 21 million people would enroll in 2016. In January, the CBO downgraded its estimate to 13 million. As of today, only 12.7 million people have signed up. Enrollment isn't likely to increase much. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, if all the states were to boost enrollment to \"at least the average of the 10 best-performing states,\" the number of sign-ups would still be fewer than 15 million over the next several years. That's about 10 million fewer than Obamacare's architects had expected. Earlier this month, the president also claimed that the uninsured rate fell below 10 percent in 2015. But there are conflicting surveys of how many uninsured are out there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that the president's figure counts just those who were uninsured at the time of the survey. When asked whether they had been uninsured at any time during the previous year, 13.8 percent said yes. A Gallup survey, meanwhile, pegged the uninsured rate at 11.9 percent at the end of 2015. According to this month's Kaiser Family Foundation poll, almost half of the uninsured said high costs were the main reason they hadn't gotten insurance. How about Obamacare's impact on employment? If anything, the president said, it's helped create jobs. He pointed to 14 million new ones since March 2010. But he ignored the fact that employment growth is at historically low levels. It's failed to keep pace with the growth of the labor force, which 15.1 million people have joined since 2010. Last month, more than three-quarters of the jobs created were part-time - partly because employers are trying to avoid Obamacare's mandates for full-timers, defined as those working at least 30 hours per week. The president has also claimed that health-care inflation is at its lowest level in decades. But the rate of health spending growth started declining in 2003, government data show, from 9 percent that year to 3.9 percent in 2009. That, of course, is the year before Obamacare became law. And health-care inflation hasn't stayed at that 2009 level. In 2014, health spending jumped 5.3 percent - more than three times the general inflation rate. What about the claim that Obamacare saves people money? Given Obamacare's trillion-dollar price tag, one might conclude that folks would be paying less for insurance.  That's hardly the case. Compared with pre-Obamacare options, individual insurance is far more expensive. Premiums have climbed an average of nearly 15 percent across the country this year. Seventeen states saw their premiums jump more than 20 percent.\u00a0Obamacare's mandates and taxes have also added to the cost of employer-sponsored insurance. Indeed, the law is expected to cost employers with more than 10,000 employees up to $186 billion - or nearly $6,000 per employee - between 2014 and 2023, according to the American Health Policy Institute. Then there are Obamacare's other costs. Insurers and government programs will pay $270 billion more in overhead costs by 2022, according to a report by public health professors at the City University of New York. Small businesses will spend an average of $15,000 per year complying with the law. There may be no better example of Obamacare's failures than the collapse of its co-ops. The president funneled $2.4 billion straight from taxpayers' wallets into these nonprofits. But 12 of Obamacare's 23 co-ops have shut down. That's forced thousands of consumers to secure alternative coverage. These failed co-ops haven't paid back $1.2 billion in federal loans - and are unlikely to ever do so. Of the remaining co-ops, eight are at risk of failure. After six years, Obamacare is collapsing. The law is more vulnerable than ever. It deserves a funeral, not a birthday party. Sally C.

Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. Through the reconciliation process, the bill removes the budgetary core of ObamaCare and is broad repeal of the disastrous healthcare law. Representative Westmoreland strongly supported this bill.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"This is a big win for the American people,\" stated Westmoreland. \"After years of increased taxes, higher premiums, costly prescriptions, and unsatisfied patients, doctors, and insurance providers, the House has passed a bill to gut the foundation of ObamaCare: it's funding. Without the revenue and funding, ObamaCare doesn't stand a chance. It's the most significant repeal package since the disastrous healthcare bill was signed into law five years ago.\u00a0\u00a0 \"We have passed multiple repeal bills in the House that have simply died in the Senate. Through the reconciliation process, the Senate was able to pass the reconciliation bill with a simple majority of 51 votes. With this, we have an opportunity to relieve the American people from the burden ObamaCare has placed on their households. The ObamaCare reconciliation bill also prohibits mandatory funding to Planned Parenthood and its affiliates, and instead reinvests that money into our community health centers. Today is a new beginning, and I look forward to working towards patient-centered and conservative solutions to our healthcare system.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Importantly, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare

state Rep. Jonathan Stickland of Bedford says his challenger in the March 2016 Republican primary, Scott Fisher, voted in favor of pushing a million Texans \"into Obamacare.\"\u00a0That's war talk for Republicans. Is it so?The narrator of the ad charges that Fisher, a Bedford church pastor, \"tried to expand Obamacare in Texas and even voted for an official resolution to force 1 million Texans into Obamacare.\"The Affordable Care Act, approved by Congress in 2010, requires most Americans to have health insurance and also permits states to widen access to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance, with Uncle Sam covering the costs for three years and picking up most costs after that. In Texas, about 1 million adults could have qualified for coverage if the state expanded access. Nobody would have been forced in; beneficiaries would have to sign up.It's an understatement to say expansion didn't catch on in Texas. In 2012, Gov. Rick Perry rejected the option, calling the offer a brazen intrusion into state sovereignty. The next year, the Republican-led Legislature \"shot down federal efforts to cover uninsured, low-income Texans by expanding access to Medicaid,\" the American-Statesman reported at the time.We asked Stickland's campaign consultant, Luke Macias, how Stickland concluded that Fisher voted to push a million Texans into Obamacare.Macias maintained that, as a member of the Tarrant County Hospital District board, Fisher in 2013 propelled approval of a \"pro-Obamacare\" resolution that mentioned the Texas effect of Medicaid expansion and urged lawmakers to consider all options to cover health care for indigent Texans which, Macias suggested, would have included Medicaid expansion. Macias said the resolution's Medicaid element added up to Fisher trying to force Texans into Obamacare.In April 2013, the Tarrant hospital board was scheduled to consider a resolution calling for Texas legislators to expand Medicaid. But during the board's April 11, 2013, meeting, according to minutes, Fisher offered an alternative proposal. That resolution opened by stating that Medicaid could insure more than a million low-income adults. But it closed by urging the Legislature to find \"sustainable\" ways to fund the care of individuals lacking health coverage - without any mention of Medicaid or the Obamacare law.The substitute resolution passed unanimously, according to the minutes, which don't show a vote on the original resolution urging Medicaid expansion. Fisher told us that he had entered the meeting believing the board shouldn't take a pro-Medicaid-expansion position, which would be \"going totally opposite the recent statement of our governor.\"\"We stripped out any call for Medicaid expansion,\" Fisher said.Our rulingStickland says Fisher \"tried to expand Obamacare in Texas and even voted for an official resolution to force 1 million Texans into Obamacare.\"At best, this claim misinterprets Fisher's motion for the hospital district board to approve a resolution asking lawmakers to fund indigent health care. The adopted proposal urges consideration of all possible sustainable options. It doesn't call for forcing Texans into Obamacare.We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!Contact W.
