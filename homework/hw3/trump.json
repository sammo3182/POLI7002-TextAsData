{"29": {"date": "March 5, 2016 Saturday", "countNoCusStop": 261, "text": "In America, the battle to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee is growing evermore bitter - not to mention childish.One of Donald Trump's rivals, Marco Rubio, has even taunted him for having \"small hands\". Trump responded, live on TV, by shouting, \"Look at those hands! Are they small hands? He referred to my hands - 'If they're small, something else must be small.' I guarantee you there's no problem! I guarantee!\" For the benefit of readers who missed the latest Republican TV debate, we present a transcript of the highlights.\u00a0Ted Cruz: \"It's vital that we keep this debate serious and mature, and don't stoop to making personal attacks. Only a douchebag like Donald would do that.\" Marco Rubio: \"I agree. We've got to focus on the issues that matter to the American people. And the most important issue is this. Donald Trump just wet his pants. Miss! Miss! Donald Trump just wet his pants, Miss!\" Donald Trump: \"Did not! Miss, I did not just wet my pants! Don't listen to Rubio, Miss! He's a rotten smelly liar. I didn't wet my pants, I didn't! You take that back.\" Ben Carson: \"I'm sorry, Donald, but the facts speak for themselves. Your pants are at their wettest since records began, having increased in wetness by 34 per cent year on year.\" Donald Trump: \"That is a total misrepresentation of the facts. The true figure is less than half that. Because the reality is, I am a big boy now. I can tie my shoes, I can go to the bathroom by myself, and I can do my times tables all the way up to 10 times 10. Unlike Ted Cruz, who by the way is afraid of the dark.\" Ted Cruz: \"That is a scandalous slur. I am not afraid of the dark. I just like to keep the bedroom light on, in case I wake up and suddenly feel like doing some reading. But I think the key question that the American people are asking is this. Donald Trump, is it true that you've never kissed a girl?\" Donald Trump: \"This is exactly the kind of garbage that proves the elites are running scared of me. Of course I've kissed a girl.\" Ted Cruz: \"Oh yeah? Who was she?\" Donald Trump: \"You wouldn't know her, she goes to another school. But let me make this important point. Alosersayswhat.\" Ted Cruz: \"What?\" Donald Trump: \"Ha ha ha ha! I said, 'A loser says what', and Ted Cruz said, 'What'! Ted Cruz is a loser!\" Ted Cruz: \"I know you are. But what am I?\" John Kasich: \"Come on, guys. This is immature.\" Donald Trump: \"Your mom's immature.\" John Kasich: \"That doesn't even make sense.\"Donald Trump: \"Your mom doesn't make sense.\"Marco Rubio: \"Shut up, Trump, you big baby.\" Donald Trump: \"Right, that's it.

Snowball the Pig is responsible for everything that is wrong on the farm. How fortunate we are to have Donald Trump.Donald Trump is the miracle product that will fix everything that is wrong in your home. He is also your father figure (put your little hand in his). He'll be your dream, your wish, your fantasy, your hope, your love, everything that you need. He is the way, the truth and the life. None shall be saved except through him.\u00a0He will protect you. He will fix your aching bones and your bad hearing and when you walk home at night you will know that nothing can harm you, because Trump is there. You will get a good-paying job. The thing in the shadows that frightens you will melt away as if it were never real to begin with. (And perhaps it wasn't.)He will also build a wall. It will be as tall as you want it to be. If you want the moon (Newt Gingrich does!), he will throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you. He will solve all your problems.Why should you believe that he will do this? Listen, you're awful nosy, aren't you? Isn't the word of Donald Trump's children enough for you? (I would say, \"And the words of his wife, Melania,\" but those turned out not to be her words.) They spent the past week praising him to the skies.Say what you will about dictators, royalty, mafia dons, supervillains and Trumps, they have a well-defined aesthetic. You get an immense, Wizard-of-Oz-scale picture of your head, some flags, and then you stand in front of it with your well-groomed family, and they say that if only people knew the real you, they would admit that you were great.Thus, Thursday night kicked off with a long, rambling speech from someone who had once seen Donald Trump write a nice note to a young boy in the middle of a Mike Tyson fight. (This was the nicest story that anyone who was not literally related to Donald Trump could come up with.)His daughter Ivanka introduced her father, saying that he had been extremely kind to and supportive of her. (If there is one thing we learned this week, it is that Donald Trump is very nice to his children. But hear me out: What if Donald Trump maybe treats his children differently than he does most people? Could that be it?) And then Donald Trump began to do what he has meant to do this whole time: talk about Donald Trump.If Barack Obama was supposed to be your new bicycle, then Donald Trump is your new miracle juicer. He looks better on TV than he actually is. He is mostly plastic and he probably won't work when you get him home. But the commercial makes him sound like the solution to everything that ails you.In this case, he went on for 76 (such a patriotic number!) minutes, advertising himself.\"I love you,\" Donald Trump said.\"I am your voice,\" Donald Trump said.\"Believe me,\" Donald Trump said.\"Nobody knows the system better than me,\" Donald Trump said, \"which is why I alone can fix it.\"How? There is no how. All that has to happen for a thing to be so is for Donald Trump to say it. This is certainly how all his statistics work.Clear your mind of questions.He will bring back law and order and end lawlessness, but also he will decrease regulations. We need more law and order, but also we need fewer laws and more freedom. Whatever is wrong, Donald Trump will fix it, even if it contradicts the thing he just fixed. The truths of religion are not the same as the truths of daily life. Faith has to get you through the day with the promise that things will improve. It does not have to withstand strict logical scrutiny. It can be an article of faith that something is two contradictory things at once. There is a hidden logic to its incoherence. It coheres because it offers a single system for fixing everything that ails you. It answers all your woes. It fits all complaints. Just like Donald Trump. Everything he touches with his hands - which are the correct size - he cures, or at least turns to gold-colored brass.Donald Trump is selling America a miracle juicer. The juicer is Donald Trump. It is orange and it will never let you down. If you order now, Donald Trump will send you another one free.Donald Trump will make America great again. \"Great\" is a vague word. It means whatever you want it to mean. Donald Trump will make America that place you see when you close your eyes.And the crowd cheered, \"Yes, you will!\"You love Donald Trump. He will be a dear, dear leader.Alexandra Petri writes the ComPost blog at washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost.", "clean_text2": "clevelandw alway war eurasia snowbal pig respons everyth wrong farm fortun

"text": "DONALD TRUMPToo scary to imagine\"I don't want the American people to think that if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress, that's going to be a scary outcome.\" - Mitch McConnell, after the 2014 midterm elections.Apparently, Donald Trump didn't get that message. He is by far the most frightening Republican candidate for president in the history of the party. Here are some of his more scary quotes:\u00a0\"Why can't we use nuclear weapons?\" - Donald Trump, with a foreign policy adviser. He asked the question three times.\"(Vladimir Putin) is not going into Ukraine, OK, just so you understand. He's not gonna go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down.\" Trump made this statement despite the fact that Russia had already taken Crimea.\"I've had a beautiful, I've had a flawless campaign.\" - Donald Trump, July 29, 2016.\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\" - Donald Trump, calling on the Russians to hack U.S. government emails to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.There are many other missteps attributed to Trump - too many to list here. He is an egocentric demagogue, and he only serves himself. I really don't care what his economic message is at this point. The only thing more scary than candidate Donald Trump would be President Donald Trump.DAVID HEWITT, TopekaANIMAL CRUELTYWe love 'em to deathToday's 10 highest grossing box office releases are about animals, including: \"Finding Dory,\" \"The Jungle Book,\" \"Zootopia,\" \"The Secret Life of Pets\" and \"Kung Fu Panda.\" Nearly half of our households include a dog, and nearly 40 percent have a cat. Two-thirds of us view them as family members and cherish them accordingly. We love our animals to death - literally.For every cat, dog or other animal that we love and cherish, we put 500 through months of caging, crowding, deprivation, mutilation and starvation - all before we take their lives, cut their dead bodies into little pieces and shove those into our mouths. And that doesn't even include Dory and billions of her little friends, because we haven't figured out how to count individual aquatic animals that we grind up for human or animal feed.The good news is that we have a choice every time we visit a restaurant or grocery store. We can choose live foods - yellow and green vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts and grains, as well as a rich variety of grain and nut-based meats and dairy products. Or we can choose dead animals - their body parts and other products of their abuse.What will it be?RICH WRAY, TopekaSUPREME COURTCheck justices' recordsOf the five Kansas Supreme Court justices who will be up for retention in the November election, Justice Caleb Stegall is the only one appointed to the court by Gov. Sam Brownback. Given Brownback's notorious incompetence in essentially everything, it will be best to vote for Stegall's ouster. The other four justices - Beier, Biles, Luckert and Nuss - were all appointed by governors prior to Brownback. These four haven't shown evidence of being Brownback's puppets, which is to their credit. However, they used extremely faulty judgment in voting to overturn the capital murder sentences of Jonathan and Reginald Carr, who committed multiple heinous murders in the Wichita area in 2000. Both of the Carrs deserve to be poster children for why Kansas should have and carry out the death sentence. The votes of these four justices about the Carrs are clear marks against their being retained. Voters need to weigh the pros and cons carefully when voting on retention.RICHARD SCHUTZ, Topeka", "clean_text2": "donald trumptoo scari imagin want american peopl think add republican presid republican congress go scari outcom mitch mcconnel 2014 midterm elect appar donald trump get messag far frighten republican candid presid histori parti scari quot use nuclear weapon donald trump foreign polici advis ask question three time vladimir putin go ukrain ok understand gon na go ukrain right mark put trump made statement despit fact russia alreadi taken crimea beauti flawless campaign donald trump juli 29 2016 russia listen hope abl find 30 000 email miss think probabl reward mightili press donald trump call russian hack u govern email undermin hillari clinton presidenti campaign mani misstep attribut trump mani list egocentr demagogu serv realli care econom messag point thing scari candid donald trump would presid donald trump david hewitt topekaanim crueltyw love em deathtoday 10 highest gross box offic releas anim includ find dori jungl book zootopia secret life pet kung fu panda near half household includ dog near 40 percent cat two third us view famili member cherish accord love anim death liter everi cat dog anim love cherish put 500 month cage crowd depriv mutil starvat take live cut dead bodi littl piec shove mouth even includ dori billion littl friend figur count individu aquat anim grind human anim feed good news choic everi time visit restaur groceri store choos live food yellow green veget legum fruit nut grain well rich varieti grain nut base meat dairi product choos dead anim bodi part product abus rich wray topekasuprem courtcheck justic recordsof five kansa suprem court justic retent novemb elect justic caleb stegal one appoint court gov sam brownback given brownback notori incompet essenti everyth best vote stegal ouster four justic beier bile luckert nuss appoint governor prior brownback four shown evid brownback puppet credit howev use extrem faulti judgment vote overturn capit murder sentenc jonathan reginald carr commit multipl heinous murder wichita area 2000 carr deserv poster children kansa carri death sentenc vote four justic carr clear mark retain voter need weigh pros con care vote retent richard schutz topeka", "title": "", "countNoStop": 342, "clean_text": "donald trumptoo scari imagin want american peopl think add republican presid republican congress go scari outcom mitch mcconnel 2014 midterm elect appar donald trump get messag far frighten republican candid presid histori parti scari quot use nuclear weapon donald trump foreign polici advis ask question three time vladimir putin go ukrain ok understand gon na go ukrain right mark put trump made statement despit fact russia alreadi taken crimea beauti flawless campaign donald trump juli 29 2016 russia listen hope abl find 30 000 email miss think probabl reward mightili press donald trump call russian hack u govern email undermin hillari clinton presidenti campaign mani misstep attribut trump mani list egocentr demagogu serv realli care econom messag point thing scari candid donald trump would presid donald trump david hewitt topekaanim crueltyw love em deathtoday 10 highest gross box offic releas anim includ find dori jungl book zootopia secret life pet kung fu panda near half household includ dog near 40 percent cat two third us view famili member cherish accord love anim death liter everi cat dog anim love cherish put 500 month cage crowd depriv mutil starvat take live cut dead bodi littl piec shove mouth even includ dori billion littl friend figur count individu aquat anim grind human anim feed good news choic everi time visit restaur groceri store choos live food yellow green veget legum fruit nut grain well rich varieti grain nut base meat dairi product choos dead anim bodi part product abus rich wray topekasuprem courtcheck justic recordsof five kansa suprem court justic retent novemb elect justic caleb stegal one appoint court gov sam brownback given brownback notori incompet essenti everyth best vote stegal ouster four justic beier bile luckert nuss appoint governor prior brownback four shown evid brownback puppet credit howev use extrem faulti judgment vote overturn capit murder sentenc jonathan reginald carr commit multipl heinous murder wichita area 2000 carr deserv poster children kansa carri death sentenc vote four justic carr clear mark retain voter need weigh pros con care vote retent richard schutz topeka", "byline": "", "countWithStop": 635, "index": "68 of 1000 DOCUMENTS"}, "6": {"date": "March 3, 2016 Thursday", "countNoCusStop": 105, "text": "Ted Cruz managed a critical win in his home state of Texas over Trump, and another in Oklahoma and Alaska.\u00a0Bernie Sanders defeated Clinton in four states: Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont.Republican Marco Rubio notched his first victory of the campaign, taking the Minnesota caucus.

'Christian' Trump supporters need to reread Bible If you consider yourself to be a Bible-believing Christian and support Donald Trump, you should Google a fellow conservative Christian (or so he claims) named Ken Shupe. Mr. Shupe owns a towing business in Asheville, North Carolina, and was called to tow the car of a woman named Casey McWade who is arthritic and needed help. While hooking up her car, he noted a Bernie bumper sticker and then claimed that God told him not to help her. Mr. Shupe is a Donald Trump supporter. Donald Trump, who wants to bring back waterboarding and worse forms of torture. Donald Trump, who wants to deport 11 million undocumented folks. Donald Trump, who wants to ban Muslims from the country. Donald Trump, who believes women who have an abortion -- a legal procedure -- should be punished. Donald Trump, who publicly mocked a handicapped person. And there are many more un-Christian utterances from him. Those who support him should be called Trumpian evangelicals, since the message he espouses bears no resemblance to the Christ of the New Testament. If you call yourself an evangelical Christian, I challenge you to read the Sermon on the Mount and Jesus' parable of the good Samaritan. It would take mental gymnastics to continue to support Mr. Trump. Since Mr. Trump, when interviewed, couldn't come up with any favorite verses from the Bible -- his favorite book -- perhaps Trumpian evangelicals need a little help finding the sermon and the parable. If you can find your Bible, read Matthew chapters 5-7, Luke chapter 10, and verses 25-37. Sherwin Kroll Springfield NC governor acting to preserve moral decency From the moment North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and the General Assembly voted to overturn Charlotte's transgender bathroom ordinance, there has been widespread reaction across the nation. Recently, Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, has thanked McCrory for doing the right thing and standing strong in defense of the recently passed law that prevents people from using a restroom or locker room that does not match their biological identity. Franklin Graham and others are speaking out in favor of this decision to safeguard citizens and preserve moral decency in this nation. Pro-family individuals should continue to defend God's standard of human sexuality and oppose the advancement of the sexual revolution values into mainstream society. I have friends who have transgender children. These parents pray for and love their children unconditionally without compromising their faith, and there is hope for those who struggle in the LGBT lifestyle. This is not only a national issue but is a spiritual and moral issue. This year Franklin Graham is traveling to all 50 states to encourage Christians to live out their faith and to pray fervently for our entire nation. As a part of the decisionamericatour.com, Franklin Graham will be coming to the state Capitol to lead a prayer rally on June 14 at noon. Everyone is invited to attend this free event. \"America is at a crossroads, and I believe we should take every opportunity to stand up for the things of God and His Word.\" -Franklin Graham.

TWP. -- When it comes to fulfilling campaign promises, if elected, Donald Trump would apply the same techniques he's used on the campaign trail, his firstborn son said at a campaign event Saturday.\u00a0\"I think he's going to be a disrupter,\" Donald Trump Jr. said. \"And that's critical here because we need somebody who's going to disrupt things, because the same-old, same-old hasn't been working.\"Mr. Trump played up his years as a youth attending the Hill School boarding school in Pottstown, later University of Pennsylvania for college, and frequent hunting and fishing trips to the mountains of Pennsylvania, as he stumped on his father's behalf.When he was a boy, Mr. Trump watched his father work as a committed businessman. Having passed the family business to his son, the elder Mr. Trump wants to use his business acumen to restore financial success and stability to America, his son said.More than 100 people packed his father's campaign office along State Street. They chanted \"Trump\" as his Cadillac Escalade pulled into the parking lot.Mr. Trump visited in advance of his father's appearance scheduled for 7 p.m. Monday -- one day before the primary election -- at Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza, Wilkes-Barre Twp.Tickets are requiredAt his side, U.S. representatives Lou Barletta, R-11, Hazleton, and Tom Marino, R-10, Lycoming Twp., pressed the crowd to mind the delegates they vote for Tuesday.Pennsylvania Republicans will send 71 delegates to the Republican National Convention in July. Of them, only 17 are bound to vote for their districts' popular candidate.The Trump campaign office is advising voters on which delegates have pledged to vote for the elder Mr. Trump.\"He's not a rubber-stamper. He's got convictions, and he lets people know what he stands for,\" said Robert Sukel of Waverly Twp., wearing a fire-engine-red cap emblazoned with the Trump slogan, \"Make America great again.\"Watching from the back of the campaign office, Bill and Susan Rice of Tunkhannock said they believe Mr. Trump would relieve big corporations of their political power and restore it to the American people.\"I think he's going to change government,\" Mrs. Rice said. \"The way it's run now, the people don't have a say in anything and he's going to change all that, make it great again, make it our government again.\"Contact the writer:joconnell@timesshamrock.com,@jon_oc on Twitter___ (c)2016 The Times-Tribune (Scranton, Pa.)

When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.\"Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been \"a gift from the comedy gods.\" He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.\"He does two crazy things every day,\" says Kimmel. \"Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.\"Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.\"I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,\" says Kimmel. \"Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.\"When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.\"I don't think he knew who I was,\" says Kimmel. \"I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.\"That was impressive, says Kimmel. \"I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.\"Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he \"immediately fell deeply in love\" with Montreal.\"It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.\"At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). \"We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,\" he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, \"played a lot of tennis back in his day.\"I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,\" says Kimmel. \"It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.\"One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.\"It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.\"Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get \"too inside\" by assuming that the audience has seen your show.\"I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting offon the wrong foot.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

John Kasich told reporters before a Saturday morning speech in Sharonville.\"Donald Trump has created a toxic environment,\" Kasich said. That \"toxic environment has allowed his supporters and those who sometimes seek confrontation to come together in violence. There is no place for this. There is no place for a national leader to prey on the fears of people who live in our great country.\"\u00a0\"It is important that we recognize their frustrations,\" Kasich said. \"It is important to recognize that there are challenges that we face -- challenges of job insecurity and a lack of rising wages, and a frustration that their children may not inherit the kind of life that they inherited from their parents. That is to be recognized. But it isn't to be used to drive people down -- it isn't used to divide people.\"\"If our rhetoric is negative, if our rhetoric is divisive, we will not solve these problems that the American people expect us to fix,\" he said.Trump apparently still has the governor's support if he becomes the party's nominee, although, \"It makes it extremely difficult,\" Kasich said.Kasich, at times angry and defiant, expressed disappointment with media coverage of the presidential campaign, and predicted that against uphill odds he will be the GOP nominee for president.\"What I would say to you is we'll see where this whole thing goes,\" Kasich said, when asked a second time if he would support Trump. \"I'm going to be the Republican nominee. I'm going to win Ohio, and do not be surprised if I go to the convention with the largest number of delegates. We have a thousand delegates yet to pick -- so don't be thinkin' that it isn't possible for me not to go there with great strength. Because it can happen.\"Other candidates finally are seeing the wisdom of taking the positive approach, Kasich said.\"I'm pleased to see that the other candidates in the last debate began to realize that name-calling, that lowering the bar on American politics is not acceptable,\" Kasich said. \"And I believe they have learned, at least in the last debate, that ideas matter, that vision matters, that policies matter, and giving people hope matters.\"\"Frankly, the coverage of this campaign has been disappointing,\" Kasich said. \"Because it seems as though the attention goes to those who call names. I refused to do it this entire campaign. Even if it meant that I would be ignored, even if it meant that I would lose.\"A day earlier, the other two GOP opponents of Trump had spoken out against violence at his rallies, while Kasich was silent when asked about it.\"Just to see Americans slugging themselves at a political rally deeply disturbed me. We're better than that. We're a nation that overcomes obstacles and challenges,\" Kasich said Saturday. \"I'm just reminded of when we worked together, in light of some terrible, terrible situations in Ohio, where we brought police and community together.\"He gave two reasons for his silence on Friday: First, he doesn't watch much TV news, he said.Also: \"You don't get down in the mud and wrestle. You have a broader vision,\" Kasich said. \"Now, yesterday, when they asked me about the violence, I didn't know what you were talking about, because I didn't see it. But I saw it last night, and put a statement up last night, and I'm sort of to the point where I've had enough of this.\"The biggest day in Kasich's campaign will be Tuesday, when Ohioans turn out for the GOP primary. He announced in late February that if he doesn't win his home state he will drop out of the race.Just up Interstate 75 from where Kasich gave his remarks at the Sharonville Convention Center, Trump a day later was to speak at 2 p.m. Sunday at The Savannah Center, at 5533 Chappell Crossing Blvd., in West Chester.In a brash anti-Kasich ad Trump's campaign unveiled on Friday, the billionaire businessman and reality television star blasts Kasich as a senior executive at Lehman Brothers, whose 2008 collapse helped spark the financial crisis that led to the Great Recession.On Friday, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's communications director, Alex Conant, said on CNN's This Hour program that Rubio supporters should vote for Kasich in Ohio, to prevent Trump from taking all Ohio's 66 delegates. That statement came with the insinuation that Kasich voters should support Rubio in Florida, in an attempt to gain a brokered political convention in Cleveland.Kasich has rejected the idea of asking his voters to support Rubio in Florida in an attempt to gain a brokered convention, where delegates would be free to vote for other candidates after the first ballot, if Trump would fail to gain the required 1,237 delegates on the first vote.___ (c)2016 the Journal-News (Hamilton, Ohio) Visit the Journal-News (Hamilton, Ohio) at www.journal-news.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

The era of economic surrender, which is what we have done essentially, is over. A new era of American greatness is going to begin,\" Trump said in Wilmington.The visits came a day after Trump's Arizona speech on immigration and a visit in Mexico with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, which Trump referenced in both speeches. It also followed a Wednesday speech by Hillary Clinton to the same veterans.Trump said of his visit with the Mexican president: \"We agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.\"He said they also talked about \"the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere.\"\"A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings and a better market for products made in the United States,\" Trump said.In Wilmington, Trump repeated his pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico but made no mention of reports that Pe\u00f1a Nieto explicitly said Mexico will not pay for the wall.\"Mexico is going to pay for the wall,\" Trump said.\"We are going to stop drugs from coming in. We have got to stop the drugs from pouring into our states. It's poisoning our youth and others,\" Trump said.Thousands of supporters in Wilmington chanted \"Build That Wall\" and \"USA\" as he delivered a 25-minute stump speech full of campaign promises, including plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, deliver a massive tax cut, create jobs and renegotiate unfair trade deals.\"No state has been hurt worse, really, by Hillary Clinton on trade policy than Ohio,\" Trump said.He said Clinton, his Democratic opponent, supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, China's entry into the World Trade Organization and the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership.The Clinton campaign said she opposes the TPP.Wilmington took a gut punch in 2008 when DHL pulled out of the Wilmington Air Park, costing 8,000 jobs. The county unemployment rate climbed above 16 percent, but by July had dropped to 5.7 percent as the air park site has been redeveloped and Wilmington-based Air Transport Services Group began flying cargo for retailer Amazon.Ann Reno, executive chair of the Clinton County Democratic Party, responded to Trump's remarks by saying the county's families know what it is like to weather hard times and bounce back.\"The choice in this election is clear: Trump's reckless plans would cost millions of jobs and devastate the economy,\" Reno said. \"Hillary Clinton would build an economy that works for everyone - not just those at the top. Trump's empty rhetoric and irresponsible ideas are not welcome here.\"In Cincinnati, Trump spoke for about 17 minutes and said his slogan for rebuilding the military will be, \"Peace through strength.\"\"We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America,\" Trump said.He focused mostly on military and veterans issues and was met with frequent applause as he promised to reform the Veterans Administration, battle the Islamic State and stop Syrian refugees from coming to the United States.Trump said Clinton supports increasing the number of Syrian refugees allowed into the United States, and he also criticized her deletion of personal emails from a private server she used for government email when she was secretary of state.The Clinton campaign issued a statement that \"despite his occasional lip service on the trail, Trump continually has disrespected our veterans and our military for decades.\"Clinton has a detailed plan to ensure veterans have the \"opportunity, care and support they earned by serving our country,\" Harrell Kirstein, Clinton campaign Ohio spokesman, said in the statement.\"She will continue to support the needs of all who serve and will continue to put veterans first.\"Neither candidate has ever served in the military. Trump, 70, received multiple education deferments and eventually got a medical deferment.Although Clinton leads in most national polls, Trump has a 10-point lead over Clinton among military households, according to a recent poll from NBC News/SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll.This support comes even though he criticized the war record of U.S. Sen.

When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.\"Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been \"a gift from the comedy gods.\" He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.\"He does two crazy things every day,\" says Kimmel. \"Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.\"Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.\"I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,\" says Kimmel. \"Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.\"When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.\"I don't think he knew who I was,\" says Kimmel. \"I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.\"That was impressive, says Kimmel. \"I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.\"Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he \"immediately fell deeply in love\" with Montreal.\"It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.\"At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). \"We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,\" he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, \"played a lot of tennis back in his day.\"I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,\" says Kimmel. \"It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.\"One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.\"It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.\"Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get \"too inside\" by assuming that the audience has seen your show.\"I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting offon the wrong foot.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

These leaders are seeing a parallel with what had happened in US politics in 1964. That year, the Republican Party candidate Barry Goldwater not only lost his bid to become the President to Lyndon Johnson, he also hurt the Party badly in other national elections like those in the Congress for years to come. Barry Goldwater had hurt the Republican Party by his anti-civil right stance that had totally alienated the African-Americans from the Republican Party.\u00a0A lot has changed in US politics since then. The votes of the African-Americans are still important. However, the Latinos/Hispanics have moved ahead of the American Americans as the second largest voting bloc in US national elections. In 2012, after President Barack Obama had returned to power easily, the Republican Party establishment had run an internal assessment to pinpoint the reasons for their defeat. One major reason that emerged out of the assessment was the way the Latinos-Hispanics voted in that election. The Latinos-Hispanics had voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Democrats. Seventy-one per cent of the Latino-Hispanic votes went to President Barak Obama while 27 to Governor Mitt Romney.The Republican Party had then concluded that unless it could increase its share of the Latino-Hispanic vote substantially in its favour, it would not have a fair chance of winning the White House. It further concluded that it would also face similar problems in elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives as well. Unfortunately, Donald Trump is not a Republican insider. He did not care for anything but the party's presidential ticket. He correctly assessed that in the Republican Party there is a big number of voters -- between 25-30 per cent -- who hate the Latinos/Hispanics, the blacks, the Muslims and the immigrants and if he aggressively insulted these groups, he would easily beat the 16 others who would be left to share the remaining 70 per cent.That is what exactly happened. Thirty per cent plus a few or minus a few of Republican voters for whom hatred is a strong motivation found in Donald Trump their hero. The more venom he spread in his hate campaign, the more these voters backed him ultimately giving him the ticket with the Republican establishment leaders watching as bystanders. Their only hope since Donald Trump assured himself of the nomination has been that he would tone down his hate rhetoric. Instead of that happening, the case of his fight with Judge Curiel has devastated the Party's leadership because it has angered the country's Latino/Hispanic population even more.Judge Curiel is linked with another dangerous development related to Donald Trump and his candidature. He is the Judge investigating the corruption in the Trump University. The way the case of the Trump University is developing, it has the potential of a dynamite to make his candidature history. Employees of the Trump University who have gone public have described it as a \"giant rip-off\" while the highest legal officer of New York State where the University is located has described it as a \"classic bait and switch scheme\".Therefore, it is out of fear of what Judge Curiel's investigation could reveal that Donald Trump attacked the Judge believing what is now his well-established style that attack is the best means of defence. Unfortunately, with the attack on the Judge, Donald Trump has further trashed the sentiments of the Latino-Hispanics. At this stage when he is going to be the Republican Party's candidate, the issue of his fight with Judge Curiel has appeared before the Republican Party leaders and conservative thinkers around the country as the virtual Red Flag. Thus, Newt Gingrich, former House Speaker urged Donald Trump to \"change his combative confrontation style before it is too late\"; House and Senate GOP leaders have condemned Donald Trump's remarks and \"donors have openly expressed their worry that losing Latino voters could doom them in key down-ballot races.\"The case with Judge Curiel is also significant as it is not just the Latino/Hispanics that Donald Trump has alienated. The attack has revealed his contempt for a system upon which a fundamental pillar of American democracy is based, namely that of the independence and impartiality of the judiciary. In attacking Judge Curiel, Donald Trump also said he would have said the same if the judge had been a Muslim. In the attack on Judge Curiel, Donald Trump has thus underlined that as president, his views on judges and the judiciary would depend on the racial and ethnic background of the judges and not on their intellect and integrity -- a very damning assessment of a fundamental institution of the country's democracy.Therefore, with Donald Trump as their candidate, the Republican Party leaders are in fear of not just losing the presidency; they are afraid that the adverse effects would be far worse. That fear was expressed by Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell who in an interview with CNN recently raised the Goldwater comparison. The Senator also made a point of what Donald Trump's hate campaign, particularly against the Latino/Hispanics is doing to the Republican Party. He said that when Ronald Reagan was elected, 84 per cent of US voters were white. That figure is now 70 per cent. He concluded from the comparison that it would be a huge mistake for the Republican Party to \"write off Latino Americans\" as Donald Trump is undoubtedly doing.Veteran Republican Party strategist Rick Wilson, expressing his anger on those GOP leaders who endorsed Donald Trump, wrote in a newspaper column: \"You own his politics. You own the racial animus that started out as a bug, became a feature and is now the defining characteristic of his campaign. You own every crazy, vile chunk of word vomit that spews from his mouth.\" He called upon the Party's leadership to ensure that Donald Trump would be sensible if it wanted to avoid the Goldwater effect that is now the Party's \"deepest fear\" that \"could last far longer than Donald Trump's political aspirations.\"The situation for the Republican Party leaders with Latino-Hispanic votes is now far worse than what it was in 2012 thanks entirely to Donald Trump. PEW Research Institute based in Washington DC in one of its latest research findings has stated that nearly 90 per cent Latino-Hispanics have now moved away from the Republican Party which would leave Donald Trump's chances of succeeding President Barack Obama very bleak indeed.The writer is a retired Ambassador.ambserajulislam@gmail.comPublished by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

spoke for about 17 minutes and said his slogan for rebuilding the military will be \"Peace through strength.\"Although Hillary Clinton leads in most polls, Donald Trump has a 10-point lead over Clinton among military households, according to a recent poll.\u00a0Donald Trump told American Legion members he would pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense system.CINCINNATI - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pledged to rebuild the American military, pursue a \"state of the art\" missile defense system and protect the country's borders during a speech at the American Legion's National Convention in Cincinnati.\"We do not want to let anyone in our country who doesn't support our values and who is not capable of loving our people,\" Trump said.It was one of two Ohio appearances Thursday, which also included an afternoon rally in Wilmington where he focused on jobs and trade deals.\"We are going to stop the foreign cheating. The era of economic surrender, which is what we have done essentially, is over. A new era of American greatness is going to begin,\" Trump said in Wilmington.The visits came a day after Trump's Arizona speech on immigration and a visit in Mexico with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, which Trump referenced in both speeches. It also followed a Wednesday speech by Hillary Clinton to the same veterans.Trump said of his visit with the Mexican president: \"We agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.\"He said they also talked about \"the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere.\"\"A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings and a better market for products made in the United States,\" Trump said.In Wilmington, Trump repeated his pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico but made no mention of reports that Pe\u00f1a Nieto explicitly said Mexico will not pay for the wall.\"Mexico is going to pay for the wall,\" Trump said.\"We are going to stop drugs from coming in. We have got to stop the drugs from pouring into our states. It's poisoning our youth and others,\" Trump said.Thousands of supporters in Wilmington chanted \"Build That Wall\" and \"USA\" as he delivered a 25-minute stump speech full of campaign promises, including plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, deliver a massive tax cut, create jobs and renegotiate unfair trade deals.\"No state has been hurt worse, really, by Hillary Clinton on trade policy than Ohio,\" Trump said.He said Clinton, his Democratic opponent, supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, China's entry into the World Trade Organization and the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership.The Clinton campaign said she opposes the TPP.Wilmington took a gut punch in 2008 when DHL pulled out of the Wilmington Air Park, costing 8,000 jobs. The county unemployment rate climbed above 16 percent, but by July had dropped to 5.7 percent as the air park site has been redeveloped and Wilmington-based Air Transport Services Group began flying cargo for retailer Amazon.Ann Reno, executive chair of the Clinton County Democratic Party, responded to Trump's remarks by saying the county's families know what it is like to weather hard times and bounce back.\"The choice in this election is clear: Trump's reckless plans would cost millions of jobs and devastate the economy,\" Reno said. \"Hillary Clinton would build an economy that works for everyone - not just those at the top. Trump's empty rhetoric and irresponsible ideas are not welcome here.\"In Cincinnati, Trump spoke for about 17 minutes and said his slogan for rebuilding the military will be, \"Peace through strength.\"\"We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America,\" Trump said.He focused mostly on military and veterans issues and was met with frequent applause as he promised to reform the Veterans Administration, battle the Islamic State and stop Syrian refugees from coming to the United States.Trump said Clinton supports increasing the number of Syrian refugees allowed into the United States, and he also criticized her deletion of personal emails from a private server she used for government email when she was secretary of state.The Clinton campaign issued a statement that \"despite his occasional lip service on the trail, Trump continually has disrespected our veterans and our military for decades.\"Clinton has a detailed plan to ensure veterans have the \"opportunity, care and support they earned by serving our country,\" Harrell Kirstein, Clinton campaign Ohio spokesman, said in the statement.\"She will continue to support the needs of all who serve and will continue to put veterans first.\"Neither candidate has ever served in the military. Trump, 70, received multiple education deferments and eventually got a medical deferment.Although Clinton leads in most national polls, Trump has a 10-point lead over Clinton among military households, according to a recent poll from NBC News/SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll.This support comes even though he criticized the war record of U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and attacked a Gold Star family who spoke out against him during the Democratic National Convention.Contact this reporterat937-225-7455 oremail Lynn.Hulsey@coxinc.com.Contactthis reporterat 614-224-1624oremail Laura.Bischoff@coxinc.com.", "clean_text2": "republican presidenti candid donald trump address american legion nation convent cincinnati thursday cincinnati donald trump spoke 17 minut said slogan rebuild militari peac strength although hillari clinton lead poll donald trump 10 point lead clinton among militari household accord recent poll donald trump told american legion member would pursu state art missil defens system cincinnati republican presidenti candid donald trump pledg rebuild american militari pursu state art missil defens system protect countri border speech american legion nation convent cincinnati want let anyon countri support valu capabl love peopl trump said one two ohio appear thursday also includ afternoon ralli wilmington focus job trade deal go stop foreign cheat era econom surrend done essenti new era american great go begin trump said wilmington visit came day trump arizona speech immigr visit mexico presid enriqu pe\u00f1a nieto trump referenc speech also follow wednesday speech hillari clinton veteran trump said visit mexican presid agre meet need stop illeg flow gun drug cash peopl across border take cartel said also talk import work keep job wealth hemispher prosper mexico mean fewer illeg border cross better market product made unit state trump said wilmington trump repeat pledg build wall along border mexico made mention report pe\u00f1a nieto explicit said mexico pay wall mexico go pay wall trump said go stop drug come got stop drug pour state poison youth other trump said thousand support wilmington chant build wall usa deliv 25 minut stump speech full campaign promis includ plan repeal replac obamacar deliv massiv tax cut creat job renegoti unfair trade deal state hurt wors realli hillari clinton trade polici ohio trump said said clinton democrat oppon support north american free trade agreement china entri world trade organ pend tran pacif partnership clinton campaign said oppos tpp wilmington took gut punch 2008 dhl pull wilmington air park cost 8 000 job counti unemploy rate climb 16 percent juli drop 5 7 percent air park site redevelop wilmington base air transport servic group began fli cargo retail amazon ann reno execut chair clinton counti democrat parti respond trump remark say counti famili know like weather hard time bounc back choic elect clear trump reckless plan would cost million job devast economi reno said hillari clinton would build economi work everyon top trump empti rhetor irrespons idea welcom cincinnati trump spoke 17 minut said slogan rebuild militari peac strength stop apolog america start celebr america trump said focus most militari veteran issu met frequent applaus promis reform veteran administr battl islam state stop syrian refuge come unit state trump said clinton support increas number syrian refuge allow unit state also critic delet person email privat server use govern email secretari state clinton campaign issu statement despit occasion lip servic trail trump continu disrespect veteran militari decad clinton detail plan ensur veteran opportun care support earn serv countri harrel kirstein clinton campaign ohio spokesman said statement continu support need serv continu put veteran first neither candid ever serv militari trump 70 receiv multipl educ defer eventu got medic defer although clinton lead nation poll trump 10 point lead clinton among militari household accord recent poll nbc news surveymonkey week elect track poll support come even though critic war record u sen john mccain r arizona prison war vietnam attack gold star famili spoke democrat nation convent contact reporterat937 225 7455 oremail lynn hulsey coxinc com contactthi reporterat 614 224 1624oremail laura bischoff coxinc com", "title": "Trump promises veterans he will rebuild U.S. military;

When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.\"Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been \"a gift from the comedy gods.\" He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.\"He does two crazy things every day,\" says Kimmel. \"Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.\"Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.\"I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,\" says Kimmel. \"Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.\"When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.\"I don't think he knew who I was,\" says Kimmel. \"I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.\"That was impressive, says Kimmel. \"I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.\"Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he \"immediately fell deeply in love\" with Montreal.\"It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.\"At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). \"We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,\" he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, \"played a lot of tennis back in his day.\"I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,\" says Kimmel. \"It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.\"One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.\"It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.\"Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get \"too inside\" by assuming that the audience has seen your show.\"I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting off on the wrong foot.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Bush and George W. Bush; 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney; and scores of current or formally elected Republican leaders decide it's better to stay home watching the Cleveland Convention from the privacy of their bedrooms than to attend the event in person.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when one of the most respected U.S. senators from either party, Republican Susan Collins of Maine, admits that she could easily find herself casting her ballot this year for her former U.S. Senate colleague, Democrat Hillary Clinton, rather than her party's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when former California Republican gubernatorial candidate and Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman claims not only will she would never vote for Donald Trump, but she considers him no better than a fascist.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when his most ardent defender on CNN News, Jeffrey Lord, was so over the top in trying to make the case that Trump had not made racist comments, that his lame defense became a national story of its own.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble when yet a second passionate defender, Katrina Pierson, made the ultimate faux pas of claiming the Indiana judge, whose parents immigrated legally from Mexico decades ago, was a member of a partisan anti-Trump group called National Council of La Raza when in fact he was a member of the California La Raza Lawyers Association, a nonpartisan legal organization. Oops.Finally, Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for President because it seems the only three ways for him to win this election are:1. Either for a majority of this year's voters turn out to be 60-plus years old, white, high-school-educated men.2. Republicans can massively suppress the vote in a half dozen key swing states.3. He can pick up the support of disillusioned Bernie Sanders partisans, even though they disagree with him on abortion rights, the death penalty, gay marriage, global warming and immigration.Michael

There is no proof that any of Curiel's decisions have been based on race.His parents came to the U.S. legally and he was born a U.S. citizen.If the son of legal immigrants can't be unbiased, who can?Almost every American is the descendent of an immigrant.

Instead of two happy twins riding a tandem bicycle to celebrate chewing gum, the Clinton-Warren sixties sister-clones - wearing blond bobs and shades of blue - rode Trump with a gobsmacking double punch. Railed the senator from Massachusetts: \"Now, Donald Trump says he'll make America great again. . . . It's stamped on the front of his goofy hat. You want to see goofy? Look at him in that hat.\"\u00a0This was her way of topping Trump's repeated use of \"goofy\" to insult her.And: \"When Donald Trump says 'great,' I ask: 'Great for who, exactly?' \" she said. \"When Donald Trump says he'll make America great, he means make it even greater for rich guys just like Donald Trump. . . . That's who Donald Trump is. . . . And watch out, because he will crush you into the dirt.\"And so the Twitter wars between a non-candidate and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee will likely continue. Doesn't Trump realize that he's the one running for president? Clinton's rally, the first to feature Warren, was followed by a sisterhood hug that only women can exchange. That simple embrace signified a new benchmark in women's and American history and changed the political narrative for all time. Not only can a woman win a major party's nomination, but also it's possible that two women can team up as running mates. The idea that Warren might become Clinton's vice presidential pick  has been floating around for a while and is appealing if only for the prospect that two women could fill an entire presidential ticket.Warren certainly is as qualified as many men who have filled the role. She obviously doesn't mind serving as the attack dog for Clinton. And Warren may be the one grinding Trump into the dirt, invective for invective. In a word, she's fearless to his careless. Warren and Clinton haven't always been so cozy, but, for the eternal record, women differ from one another in as many ways as men do. Warren is further to the left than Clinton ever meant to be. And she comes far more naturally to a populist message. While Clinton was being forced leftward by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Warren was continuing her years-long progressive crusade. Her endorsement of Clinton and her new role as a rowdy, crowd-warming act constitute a bridge between Sanders supporters and the presumptive nominee they never wanted. Warren captures the anger and anti-1-percent angst of the liberal left and lays it like a wreath at the feet of the woman who would become the first female president. Warren is a peace offering who aims to wage war on Trump. And she's on to his greatest weakness. He can't take a ribbing and he can't stand being challenged by a woman. It gets under his skin like nothing else. Thus, when Warren says he looks goofy in a hat, he calls her Pocahontas (for her having said she has Native American blood).What's clear is that Warren won't back down no matter what Trump tosses her way. Speaking strictly as an observer, I think  Trump may be losing his ranking as top draw in the political circus. If Warren stays on the stage, it's nearly assured that all eyes will be on her - which might cause Clintonites some concern.Like Trump, Warren has that certain something that fills arenas and draws people to their feet. That's where the similarities end. A Harvard law professor before she ran for the U.S. Senate, Warren is smart, eloquent on consumer protection issues and passionately committed to well-defined principles. One needn't agree with her to appreciate her vigor, as well as a steely-eyed softness that comes across in person. Unlike Trump, she's in possession of an agreeable personality. Even when yelling across a surging crowd, she manages to avoid sounding strident. Close up, she's warm, engaging and nonthreatening.Most important, she allows Clinton to step back from the fray and gives everyone a chance to imagine what a two-woman ticket could look like. Too much the same? Too soon for two? For whom?It may be true, as someone wrote me, that Clinton's greatest virtue is her opponent. But it's also plain that Warren is her greatest asset.

media is predicting that vitriolic voters in the Upper Midwest are the key to unlocking the White House for Donald Trump.It's almost conventional wisdom: We in the \"Rust Belt\" will swarm to Trump because the average middle-class worker believes Trump can magically reverse the ravages of the modern global economy. Or, short of that, blow up the status quo trying. And by mobilizing this base of older, white, working-class men in his anti-establishment crusade, Trump can compete in traditional Democratic-leaning states and redraw the Electoral College map.It isn't only Fox News and right-wing talk radio espousing this, but publications such as The Economist, The New York Times, The New Yorker and The Atlantic, among others.\u00a0\"Rustproofing,\" reads the headline in the latest edition of The Economist, asking in the subhead: \"Can Donald Trump flip the old manufacturing regions of the Midwest?\" A recent op-ed in the Times was headlined, \"Donald Trump's Appeal to Rust Belt workers.\" The New Yorker's headline: \"Donald Trump and the idea of the Rust Belt.\" And The Atlantic: \"Donald Trump's Path to the Presidency Runs through the Rust Belt.\"So there appears to be consensus among East Coast media that we in manufacturing regions around the Great Lakes are so damn angry about our stagnating prospects that we are susceptible to a demagogue like Trump.I suspect this broad-brush analysis results in part from the spectacle of Trump's primary campaign, which memorably featured images of not only the angriest, but also the most racist and anti-immigrant citizens among us. The size of that group may be finite, but we sure have seen a lot of them lately. They made for good television, while displays of centrism and pragmatism are relegated to C-SPAN, public television and wonky podcasts.This stereotyping of flyover country as a region filled with decay and anger seems widely held. Consider the very term \"Rust Belt,\" a 1980s descriptor that suggests that the whole of the Great Lakes region resembles only its most distressed inner cities.Wisconsin, of course, is trying to evolve and reinvigorate its economy by moving from reliance on manufacturing jobs toward jobs with a technology component. It doesn't help to have the state linked to rust ? a word whose synonyms include dilapidated, decaying, crumbling and corroded.A digression: Last month, Dave Cieslewicz began his column in Isthmus with this: \"We are not the #%&*@ Rust Belt, for cryin' out loud.\" The former two-term mayor emailed me to enlist my support in his campaign to, well, combat rust. He called the description damaging, inaccurate and insulting. (I'm a bit tardy here, Dave, but I agree.) But I think there is something more sinister and, I hope, misguided in this narrative of regional white male backlash in favor of Trump.Trump's \"make America great again\" mantra has been described as a euphemism for \"make America white again.\" His focus on race, his support for mass deportation of immigrants, and his crusade against Muslims is not who we really are here in the heartland.Much has been written about how the Democratic Party lost the South a half century ago by defying the former Confederate states on civil rights. But nativism and racial animus have never been central to our regional identity, and it is hard to imagine them being so now.Besides, if Trump pushes too far to attract disaffected white men he will likely lose many other voters, especially women and those with more education.\"The limits on this strategy include the countervailing effect among college-educated voters, Millennials and minorities,\" Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg said in The Atlantic's Rust Belt analysis. \"But it may be equally important that half of the working class (women) are put off by him.\"In the same article, Henry Olsen, a conservative analyst at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, said that what Trump is \"doing is offering a voice to those (white working-class) people's beliefs and aspirations in a way that no Republican that has run for president has done.\"Which is why I think he could do better with them, but worse in the suburbs, and that's his challenge. If you do better, for instance, in rural Wisconsin but significantly worse in Madison and small suburbs of Green Bay and the exurbs of Milwaukee ... you don't do overall better. That's the challenge he faces, which is the reverse of the typical Republican challenge; they can speak to suburbanites but they can't speak to these (blue-collar) people.\"It is also worth recalling that Ted Cruz handily defeated Trump in Wisconsin's April GOP primary, 48 percent to 35 percent.My bet is Trump will lose Wisconsin and mostly fail in selling his repugnant political brand to general election voters in other parts of the region.Still, I am disappointed that it is even a discussion. For that matter, I am disappointed by the appeal of both Trump and Bernie Sanders, as protest candidates. Both promise to recreate the good old days by blocking or unwinding trade deals, for instance. Their shared message is not that the economy is rapidly evolving and needs nuanced governance, but ? always ? that dark forces are rigging the game.You can see the effect of this appeal even on a good-government, centrist candidate like Hillary Clinton. Instead of talking about the need for a balancing act on trade, she is focusing mostly on, for example, how Trump's furniture brand is made not in the U.S. but in Turkey. Opined The Economist: \"This is good politics, but it makes a gloomy spectacle for those who think trade makes America, and the world, richer.\"Some of us believe a brighter economic future requires more than conspiracy theories about immigrants and trade deals. Instead it requires investment in infrastructure, education and job training, coupled with tax incentives and safety nets for individuals, financed by a tax system that recognizes growing wealth disparities.Even out here in the land of rust, one can hope.", "clean_text2": "probabl notic nation media predict vitriol voter upper midwest key unlock white hous donald trump almost convent wisdom rust belt swarm trump averag middl class worker believ trump magic revers ravag modern global economi short blow status quo tri mobil base older white work class men anti establish crusad trump compet tradit democrat lean state redraw elector colleg map fox news right wing talk radio espous public economist new york time new yorker atlant among other rustproof read headlin latest edit economist ask subhead donald trump flip old manufactur region midwest recent op ed time headlin donald trump appeal rust belt worker new yorker headlin donald trump idea rust belt atlant donald trump path presid run rust belt appear consensus among east coast media manufactur region around great lake damn angri stagnat prospect suscept demagogu like trump suspect broad brush analysi result part spectacl trump primari campaign memor featur imag angriest also racist anti immigr citizen among us size group may finit sure seen lot late made good televis display centrism pragmat releg c span public televis wonki podcast stereotyp flyover countri region fill decay anger seem wide held consid term rust belt 1980s descriptor suggest whole great lake region resembl distress inner citi wisconsin cours tri evolv reinvigor economi move relianc manufactur job toward job technolog compon help state link rust word whose synonym includ dilapid decay crumbl corrod digress last month dave cieslewicz began column isthmus rust belt cryin loud former two term mayor email enlist support campaign well combat rust call descript damag inaccur insult bit tardi dave agre think someth sinist hope misguid narrat region white male backlash favor trump trump make america great mantra describ euphem make america white focus race support mass deport immigr crusad muslim realli heartland much written democrat parti lost south half centuri ago defi former confeder state civil right nativ racial animus never central region ident hard imagin besid trump push far attract disaffect white men like lose mani voter especi women educ limit strategi includ countervail effect among colleg educ voter millenni minor democrat pollster stanley greenberg said atlant rust belt analysi may equal import half work class women put articl henri olsen conserv analyst ethic public polici center said trump offer voic white work class peopl belief aspir way republican run presid done think could better wors suburb challeng better instanc rural wisconsin signific wors madison small suburb green bay exurb milwauke overal better challeng face revers typic republican challeng speak suburbanit speak blue collar peopl also worth recal ted cruz handili defeat trump wisconsin april gop primari 48 percent 35 percent bet trump lose wisconsin most fail sell repugn polit brand general elect voter part region still disappoint even discuss matter disappoint appeal trump berni sander protest candid promis recreat good old day block unwind trade deal instanc share messag economi rapid evolv need nuanc govern alway dark forc rig game see effect appeal even good govern centrist candid like hillari clinton instead talk need balanc act trade focus most exampl trump furnitur brand made u turkey opin economist good polit make gloomi spectacl think trade make america world richer us believ brighter econom futur requir conspiraci theori immigr trade deal instead requir invest infrastructur educ job train coupl tax incent safeti net individu financ tax system recogn grow wealth dispar even land rust one hope", "title": "PUSHING BACK ON THE ?RUST BELT' NARRATIVE;

When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.\"Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been \"a gift from the comedy gods.\" He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.\"He does two crazy things every day,\" says Kimmel. \"Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.\"Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.\"I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,\" says Kimmel. \"Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.\"When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.\"I don't think he knew who I was,\" says Kimmel. \"I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.\"That was impressive, says Kimmel. \"I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.\"Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he \"immediately fell deeply in love\" with Montreal.\"It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.\"At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). \"We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,\" he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, \"played a lot of tennis back in his day.\"I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,\" says Kimmel. \"It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.\"One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.\"It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.\"Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get \"too inside\" by assuming that the audience has seen your show.\"I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting offon the wrong foot.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Even recently, there were serious speculations in the media that both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would have to fight until their respective convention to become their respective party's candidate.President Obama appeared on MSNBC TV's popular Tonight Show after Hillary Clinton won the June 07 California primary and became the presumptive candidate of the Democratic Party. The interviewer Jimmy Fallon asked the President whether the Republicans were happy to have chosen Donald Trump as their candidate. The President answered spontaneously that he did not know about the Republicans but that he was certain that the Democrats were indeed happy much to the cheer of the audience that was present in the TV station watching the interview live. The President was no doubt underlining the feeling in the Hillary Clinton camp that with the type of problems Donald Trump's candidature is stuck where his own party leaders have called him \"racist\" after his attack on Judge Gonzalo Curiel for his Mexican heritage, it would be easy sailing for the former Secretary of State.\u00a0The President thereafter paused. He then expressed views that underlined why he is, the inexplicable hatred of his opposition to him notwithstanding, a great president and perhaps the best that the country has seen for a long time of issues of morals and their importance in politics. He said that the America is a great and democratic country for a variety of reasons among which the way the country has based its politics on the two-party system is a very important one. He said that the Democrats have been left of centre while the Republicans, right of the centre and from those positions they for generations differed fiercely on principles, argued strongly on issues but in the end came together on what was important for the country.He thought that Donald Trump's candidature has been breaking that two-party system and endangering the welfare of the country. He hoped that somewhere down the race for the White House, the Republican Party would come together or that Donald Trump would change his style so that the two-party system he has been destroying would be saved and the country's democratic stability and future assured. The President's thoughts on the two-party system underlined the spirit of bipartisanship that has figured ahead of party interests in the way he ran the country in his two terms as the President. It also underlined, notwithstanding the casual way he stated it, that with an unreformed Donald Trump and a Republican Party unable to reform him, Hillary Clinton would have no serious contest for the White House.The President could be right because Donald Trump's candidature is now sinking over his fight with Judge Curiel who is investigating fraud in the activities of the Trump University. The Republican Party establishment widely condemned the remark. House Speaker Paul Ryan said that Donald Trump's comment on the Judge was \"textbook definition of a racist comment.\" The hue and cry from the Republican establishment failed to have any effect on Donald Trump who has remained unrepentant. Outside the party, very few had any doubt about Donald Trump as a racist from his repeated remarks on Muslims, blacks, Latino-Hispanics and immigrants. With the Republican Party establishment itself now accepting the dangerously damaging view, it is not difficult to understand why there was a smile on the President's face when he answered Jimmy Fallon's question.In fact, some Republicans are jumping the Republican ship now that the candidature of Donald Trump is a reality. In the 1/3rd Senate seats that would be contested on November 08, there are quite a few where the Republican candidates are facing tough contests. For these Republicans, the racial nature of Donald Trump's campaign against the minorities, particularly the Latino-Hispanic, has become a nightmare. As a consequence, some of these Republicans are distancing themselves from Donald Trump by \"un-endorsing\" their earlier endorsements for him. Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois withdrew his endorsement with the following statement: \"After much consideration, I have concluded that Donald Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to assume the greatest office in the world.\" David Johnson, a state senator in Iowa, left the Reublican Party altogether with the statement that he \"would not stand silent if the party of Lincoln and the end of slavery buckles under the racial bias of a bigot.\"At this stage, it appears like Donald Trump has bitten more than he can chew with his racial and religious bigotry. Now it is not only the rest of the country outside the Republican Party that is jittery with him and his candidature; within the party that feeling has now becoming widespread. In fact, with the anger on Donald Trump over his ill-advised comments on Judge Curiel now inflamed over his refusal to apologise, the Republican Party leadership is now seriously considering the alternative to nominating him as the candidate. That would of course be difficult because Donald Trump has already collected, democratically, the required number of delegates to take the Republican nomination in the party's convention in Cleveland, Ohio from July 18-21.Donald Trump has also totally confused the Republican Party leaders. This has been amply underlined by Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell in a new Bloomberg Politics podcast recently. In that, the Senator said that Donald Trump \"needs someone highly experienced and very knowledgeable because it's pretty obvious he doesn't know a lot about the issues.\" The Senator said he had reached that conclusion after watching him \"in the debates in which he had participated.\" He disagreed with everything Donald Trump has said on the campaign trail and that he \"vehemently objected\" to his attacks on various ethnic groups. The Senator felt that the problem with Donald Trump thus far has been the fact that he did not speak publicly from the script and that once in the White House \"he'll have to respond to the right-of-centre world which elected him, and the things that we believe in.\"The Senator, however, had nothing to state how Donald Trump would be encouraged to follow the script. He also did not explain how the damage that Donald Trump's public utterances had already caused his candidature and the party would be repaired. Instead, he said he was \"comfortable supporting him\" and that once in the White House, would \"respond to the right of the centre world that elected him.\" There are so many gaps in the Senator's assumptions and conclusions that it only underlines the utter confusion in the Republican Party with Donald Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan after calling Donald Trump a racist went on to state that to defeat Hillary Clinton, he too would support Donald Trump.Therefore, the Republican Party leadership is in the predicament where they are being forced to back a candidate who has now won himself the trademark of a racist candidate by its own admission. Donald Trump has no confusions or worries about his well-deserved trademark. He has shown no signs of retracting any of his remarks and beliefs that have won him that trademark. It is up to America to decide whether, on November 08, it would be willing to elect such a candidate to the White House. There are millions of racists in the United States. However, it is unlikely even a majority of them, who have thus far energised his campaign, would now be willing to be themselves labelled racist as they surely would if they now vote for him.The writer is a retired Ambassador.ambserajulislam@gmail.comPublished by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Melania, center, with, from left, daughter Tiffany, Donald Trump Jr., daughter Ivanka, and son Eric. In the front row are kai Trump, left, and Donald Trump III, children of Donald Trump Jr.Calamari MatthewHicks Hope\u00a0Donald Trump, famous for firing people, now has to make his most important hire - a running mate on the Republican presidential ticket.Trump says he doesn't know who he'll choose, but a look at his career as real estate developer, reality TV host and political candidate gives some clues as to how he'll make his decision and what type of person he might tap.Although his campaign has yet to establish a selection committee - except to say Ben Carson would be on it - Trump says he wants an experienced politician who can help him with Congress, which doesn't narrow things down much.What is clear is that Trump usually hires by gut, not committee. He values capability above experience, aggressiveness above credentials and loyalty above all. Unlike many candid bosses, he accepts candor from employees.If you're good-looking, that's good. If you're family, that's best.Trump isn't appointing a construction manager or anointing an Apprentice winner. \"This is a whole new process at a whole new level,\" says Wayne Barrett, a former Village Voice reporter who has investigated Trump's business deals. \"He has an eye for business talent. Whether he has one for political talent is another question.\"Michael D'Antonio, author of a Trump biography, Never Enough, wonders how Trump will reach his decision: \"He'd probably be best served by a sober, deliberative process, but when has he ever had to hire someone who mattered this much?\"Here are the types of people Trump traditionally likes to hire:NOVICESTrump takes chances on unknowns. Matthew Calamari, the Trump Organization COO, was working security at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in 1981 when Trump spotted him evicting some hecklers and hired him to handle his own security.Such hires are less expensive and more loyal, D'Antonio says: \"He doesn't require first-tier people. I think he's kind of uncomfortable with them. If he can pluck you from a less prominent place and pay you well, he prefers that.\"Trump's original campaign staff, which helped pull off one of the biggest upsets in U.S. political history, consisted of \"people who would never have been hired to do what they're doing by a campaign that was sane,\" Stuart Stevens, strategist for Mitt Romney in 2012, told The Hill this year.Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager, had never run a successful statewide race. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman, was doing Trump corporate PR and had never worked for a political campaign.That's fine with Trump. \"He wants diamonds in the rough,\" says Gwenda Blair, a biographer.WOMENTrump has hired many female executives. They include Norma Foerderer, who was his top assistant, and Barbara Res, construction manager for Trump Tower.Naming a woman head of a big construction project was unheard of in 1980. Res says that when Trump hired her, he told her, \"Men are better than women, but a good woman is better than 10 men.\" His logic: A woman who has succeeded in a sexist system had to be outstanding.INSIDERSTrump likes to hire and promote people he knows. \"They don't have drug problems, they don't have alcohol problems,\" he told Bloomberg last year. \"I would rather take guys at a lower level and move them up than hire people that you have no idea who they are.\"Calamari rose from security chief to COO. Foerderer, hired as a secretary, became executive vice president. Trump's social media wizard, Justin McConney, is the son of the Trump Organization controller and has been with Trump companies since 2009. A small San Antonio firm that's worked for Trump since 2011 was hired to build the campaign website.Trump took a liking to Res after he saw the 31-year-old engineer stand up to an architect at a meeting on Trump's first big project, the conversion of the old Commodore Hotel at Grand Central Terminal into a Hyatt. Next thing she knew, she was sitting in his living room listening to his plans for Trump Tower.RELATIVESTrump always has relied on family. Ivana, his first wife, helped manage his Atlantic City casinos and ran the Plaza Hotel. Their children - Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric - largely run the Trump Organization.Most corporate websites have biographies of key managers. The Trump Organization's doesn't mention anyone whose last name isn't Trump.TRUTH-TELLERSRonald Kessler, a journalist who met Trump while working on a book about Palm Beach, says he \"expects candor in people he hires. It's the one thing that really stands out.''Up to a point. Once a decision has been made, Blair notes, Trump expects complete loyalty - \"someone who'll jump when he says jump.\"ADVERSARIES\"I often hire people that were on the opposing side of a deal that I respect,\" Trump told Newsday in 1989. In the early '80s, he sued New York City Housing Commissioner Anthony Gliedman personally for blocking a $25 million tax abatement for Trump Tower. In 1986, after a lunch in Little Italy, Gliedman agreed to join the Trump Organization and leave the administration of Mayor Ed Koch.LOOKERSTrump cares about a prospective hire's hairstyle, weight and attire. The winning Apprentice contestant often was the best-looking. Hicks, the spokeswoman, is a former model.For Trump, attractive equals successful, D'Antonio says: \"It's very important that someone look the part.\"CHARACTERS ... AS IN STORIESTrump likes hires with a good back story. Gliedman's showed Trump's willingness to bury the hatchet. Res' showed his focus on talent.Trump \"believes in the power of story,\" D'Antonio says, \"especially a surprising one.\"HOW DOES HE DO IT?As instructive as who Trump has hired over the years is how: instinctively, quickly, personally.He doesn't rely on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or references. \"He believes in nothing more than he believes in his gut,\" D'Antonio says. Res says it's simple: \"He sees people, he likes 'em, he hires 'em.\"In 1981, Trump hired Foerderer, who had no experience in the private sector, let alone real estate, based on a meeting that lasted five minutes. She served him for more than two decades.For a presidential nominee choosing a running mate, Trump's hiring patterns and practices have some pros and many cons.He can't pick a relative, an employee or a novice. Good looks don't count. Trump's limited number of politician supporters don't offer much gravitas, except possibly Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.A methodical vetting could be essential if Trump doesn't want a running mate who will blow up in his face.\"Intuitively is not how it's done anymore,\" says Joel Goldstein, a St. Louis University Law School expert on the vice presidency. \"And when it was, the people involved had served together and knew each other very well.\"Res says, \"He will listen to his advisers. There's too much at stake not to.\"D'Antonio agrees but wonders if Trump is too much like a rebellious teenager: \"If he can do what everyone says he shouldn't and get away with it, he wants to do it.\"Potential vice presidential candidates could be leery of going down with Trump's pirate ship or serving under such a notorious micromanager and spotlight hog.While Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton leads in general election polls, the kind of hiring \"good story\" Trump likes might come in handy - like Marco Rubio, whom Trump relentlessly derided as \"Little Marco,\" joining the ticket.Don't scoff, D'Antonio says: \"Trump is the most manipulative person in the world. He's capable of persuading almost anyone, who's even a bit receptive, to join his ticket.\"Kessler says Trump himself doesn't hold grudges. In Palm Beach, for example, he made peace with private clubs who opposed his conversion of his Mara-Lago estate into one. And he's reached a rapprochement with Fox News' Megyn Kelly, with whom he's feuded.As far as Kessler is concerned, the point is moot - \"I'm sure he's already decided in his mind who it will be.\" Kessler's sure it's Rubio. And he's sure Trump can hire him.", "clean_text2": "candid donald trump speak ralli thursday charleston w va trump famili republican presidenti candid donald trump wife melania center left daughter

establishment denied that a Donald Trump candidacy could possibly be viable. It had to be some kind of joke. Then came palpable anger as Trump dominated debates and began sweeping primary after primary.\u00a0Some establishment figures, such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, decided that the only way to deal with the Trump phenomenon was to bargain with him - as if Donald Trump were someone that a reasonable person could work with. Then, when the establishment realized it was far too late to deny Trump the 1,237 delegates he needed to lock up the Republican nomination, there was mass depression.Denial, anger, bargaining, depression. Now comes the last of Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross' five stages of grief: acceptance. Trump is almost certainly going to be the Republican Party's presidential nominee.Despite what many readers think, this newspaper is not anti-Republican. We like good ideas wherever they come from. Our problem with Trump is that he has yet to offer a single well-honed good idea. He's thrown out some interesting concepts, but they've been swamped by unworkable solutions and racist, sexist vitriol.The party of Lincoln should be grieving over the triumph of Trump, which was largely sealed by his overwhelming victory in Indiana's primary on Tuesday. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz quickly withdrew and was soon followed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Nothing stands in the way of Trump's freight train.Had Republicans opted for Kasich, who dreams of a contested GOP convention in July, Americans would have had a fair choice between his conservative record and the ideas of the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Trump has no record, and his ideas are a mystery mishmash.Trump is the most unpopular presidential candidate posted by either party in the past three decades, according to data compiled by The Washington Post, a fact that only works for Clinton. But as 16 former GOP candidates can attest, only a fool would dismiss the seriousness of a Trump presidential bid.Party leaders still don't know how to react. They can methodically deny him access to the funds he needs to keep his campaign afloat, turning attention instead to down-ballot races, hoping that Trump doesn't take GOP congressional candidates down with him.A third-party candidacy could develop in hopes of splitting the vote and denying Trump any chance at victory. This would hand the presidency to the Democrats, which many conservatives regard as unacceptable.Which leaves the party with another option: Get behind this candidate, something many prominent Republicans say they will never do.One thing is certain: A big part of the GOP base has spoken loudly and clearly. These voters demand a shake-up of the establishment.

Mike Pence appeared in Dalton Tuesday, state Rep. Rick Jasperse, R-Jasper, sat on the stage behind him at the trade center, showing his support for Pence and for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\"When people ask me why I am supporting Donald Trump, I try to make my answer as simple as possible,\" Jasperse said Thursday night at a meeting of the Murray County Republican Party in Chatsworth. \"The courts are very important. In the Legislature, we can pass laws. But the courts can overturn those laws or reinterpret them in ways that we may not have intended. And I know that Donald Trump is much more likely to appoint conservative judges and Supreme Court justices than Hillary Clinton.\"\u00a0Jasperse represents District 11 in the state House of Representatives, which includes parts of Murray, Gordon and Pickens counties.But several members of the audience pressed him on why a number of local elected officials who are Republican weren't at the Pence rally in Dalton on Tuesday.Dalton resident Larry Swanson, for instance, noted that members of the Whitfield County Board of Commissioners were not there.Jasperse said he could not speak for other Republicans but noted that several legislative committees were meeting in Atlanta and some members of the Legislature may have had official business that conflicted with the afternoon rally.Reached Friday, Whitfield County Board of Commissioners Mike Babb noted that the rally was announced on Friday, Aug. 26, which was relatively short notice. He said he had a conflicting meeting in LaFayette, where he and officials from several other neighboring counties received checks from the Association of County Commissioners of Georgia for good results in their worker's compensation programs.\"My presence or absence at the rally won't make any difference in the presidential election, but I wanted to get that $24,000 check for the county,\" he said.Commissioner Lynn Laughter said her schedule was also full.\"This was announced on pretty short notice. I had clients booked all day,\" said Laughter, who is a financial adviser.But at Thursday's Republican Party meeting some worried about the impact that Republican elected officials who don't seem to be supporting Trump could have on the November election.\"People need to understand this is a binary decision. If you don't vote for Trump, you are effectively voting for Hillary Clinton,\" said Ed Painter.Jasperse agreed with that point.\"I know from experience. I voted for Ross Perot, so, in effect, I helped elect Bill Clinton, and I regret that,\" he said.But Jasperse said he didn't believe Republican leaders in the state House of Representatives needed to lean on members to publicly support Trump.\"I think that's the job of people like the people in this room,\" he said. \"They elect us, and they need to tell us what it important to them and what they expect us to do.\"Jasperse noted that Murray County is now a heavily Republican area and Trump handily won Murray County in the Republican presidential primary earlier this year with 57 percent of the vote.But he presented numbers showing that Murray County tends to lag the state as a whole significantly in turnout and urged party members to start knocking on doors urging people to vote to get that turnout up in November.___ (c)2016 The Daily Citizen (Dalton, Ga.)

Republicans backing the real estate mogul's opponents with renewed vigor ahead of Tuesday's primary vote.But Trump's campaign has been a direct assault on the so-called political establishment forces that were quick to condemn him, leaving it unclear what the long-term results of Trump's University of Illinois Chicago non-rally will be.\"Donald Trump created that hostile environment,\" said state Rep. Ed Sullivan, a Mundelein Republican and backer of Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\u00a0He predicted a backlash against Trump. But if there isn't one, Sullivan said, \"God help us.\"Conservative radio host and former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh was among those who was quick to retort. He has not formally backed a presidential candidate but has said he can relate to Trump's push against the Republican establishment.\"They didn't just cancel Trump's rally last night,\" Walsh posted to Twitter. \"They shut down speech. They spit on America. They awakened the silent majority.\"All of Trump's opponents on the Illinois primary ballot -- Kasich, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz criticized Trump swiftly after the cancellation was announced.But with their supporters split and not uniting behind a single alternative, it's unclear if any one of them will be able to overtake Trump's vote totals in Illinois or in Ohio or Florida where more convention delegates are at stake Tuesday.A protester at a Trump event at an airport hangar near Dayton, Ohio, on Saturday leapt over a barricade, jumping into the security buffer surrounding the stage from which Trump was speaking.Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer says Thomas Dimassimo of Fairborn, Ohio, has been charged with inducing panic and disorderly conduct.Dimassimo was stopped by several U.S. Secret Service agents and other officers, but not before making his way to the stage itself. Several Secret Service agents surrounded Trump on stage briefly while Dimassimo was detained and removed from the area.Speaking at a rally later Saturday in St. Lois, Trump told the crowd about the incident and said that, after learning the man's name, one of his \"Internet people\" discovered something shocking: alleged evidence that linked Dimassimo to Islamic State militants.\"It was probably ISIS or ISIS-related. Do you believe it?\" Trump asked the crowd. He said that an online search had revealed \"the guy is playing all sorts of, let's say music that you wouldn't be liking, dragging an American flag along the sidewalk, making all sorts of gestures, having all sorts of things on the Internet. And he's probably or possibly ISIS-related.\"Trump appeared to be referring to a video, which was posted on his official Twitter account, that shows student protesters stepping on American flags, declaring, \"Black Live Matters\" and talking to reporters while religious music plays. It appears to be an edited version of a video posted on YouTube in April 2015 captioned, \"Students at Wright State University #NotMyFlag protest.Hassan Hassan, the co-author of the book \"ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,\" says the video is \"definitely not an ISIS video\" based on its content.\"This is utterly farcical; the video is incontrovertibly fake and Trump's accusations about it being linked to ISIS serve only to underline the totality of his ignorance on this issue,\" said Charles Lister, a fellow at the Middle East Institute.But Saturday night in Kansas City, Missouri as protesters made their mark at his latest rally, Trump seemed to relish the interruptions -- repeatedly ridiculing them as people with a \"little weak voice\" and saying \"go home to mommy.\" Even while stirring up his boisterous supporters, he asked security to be \"very gentle\" when taking the protesters out. About 20 minutes into his remarks, more than a dozen demonstrators were escorted out.Meanwhile, at the St. Patrick's Day parade In Chicago on Saturday, Gov. Bruce Rauner made only brief remarks about the bedlam the night before. He has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race and hasn't said much about Trump's rise.\"There is no place for violence in our political discourse,\" Rauner said, referring to two police officers who were injured, one of whom was hit in the head by a bottle and needed stitches. \"I hope the police officers are OK and that they recover quickly.\"\"Protesting and letting people's views be known is fine,\" he said. \"No place for violence.\"* The Associated Press contributed to this story.", "clean_text2": "bipartisan backlash follow donald trump friday ralli cancel swift harsh leav

turned up at his Aberdeenshire golf resort to back the tycoon's bid for the US presidency.Members of the far-right group posed outside the Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeenshire with a banner stating they supported his bid for the White House.The Scottish National Front said they agreed with Trump's incendiary remarks about banning Muslims from entering the US and building a wall along the border with Mexico.\u00a0But a spokesman for Trump branded the actions of the group \"opportunistic\" and insisted they had not accepted any endorsements from them.A post on social media by the National Front  Scotland shows three men posing next to the sign at the entrance of the course on Sunday.Wearing jeans and baseball caps, they are pictured holding a large black banner with a photo of Donald Trump's face.It reads: \"National Front Scotland supports Donald Trump for president. Keep the United States safe!\"The National Front is known for far-right views on race and immigration, including a policy of expelling all \"non whites\" from the UK. The Scottish branch describe themselves as \"White racial nationalists\".A spokeswoman at Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, said:  \"Firstly, we are not a political organisation and the UK has nothing to do with US politics.  \"This is nothing more than an opportunistic attempt to gain publicity off the back of Mr Trump's highly successful presidential campaign.\"The Trump Organisation has not accepted any endorsements from groups of this kind.\"Donald Trump has faced a worldwide backlash during his campaign over his opposition to Muslims and Mexicans being allowed into America.READ MORE: {http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/donald-trump-wins-nevada-republican-primary-1-4037031 |  Donald Trump wins Nevada Republican primary}Dave Macdonald, the Aberdeenshire-based chairman of the UK National Front, is among the men in the photograph.He said: \"The one thing we don't agree with is the outpouring of abuse towards Donald Trump regarding some of his controversial comments.\"The main thing is the Scottish Government coming out in favour of him being banned, which we thought was a disgrace considering his millions of investment he's brought to Scotland. \"Asked if he agreed with Mr Trump's controversial comments about Muslims and Mexicans, he said: \"Oh yes.\"The wall would be more difficult, it would cost a lot of money. As regards the other issue, it would be easier to do because you would just stop them coming into the country full stop.\"\"I don't agree with all the stuff he comes out with, especially the stuff about people with disabilities. But some of the other stuff, yes.\"Ironically, the National Front supporters ended up chatting to an \"African American\" security guard outside the golf course.\"The security officer, said he was going to make sure it was passed through the network that there was support from Scotland,\" said Mr Macdonald.\"He was African American.

Trump had loudly and proudly proclaimed were supporting his campaign, both reported to the press they had offered no such support.\u00a0Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for

currently a secret practitioner of the Muslim faith.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when the overwhelming reaction from neutral observers regarding his first social-media post following the Orlando nightclub massacre was, as usual, about himself and not about the innocent victims who were massacred.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president because it has become quite clear the more the press investigates his business practices from his past, the more obvious it is to all that his bloviating about his alleged past successes are at best inflated, and at worst simply untrue.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when folks like William Johnson, the head of the whites-only American Freedom Party, publicly laud him as \"the great white hope\" for America.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when such noted political figures as former Republican Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush; 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney; and scores of current or formally elected Republican leaders decide it's better to stay home watching the Cleveland Convention from the privacy of their bedrooms than to attend the event in person.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when one of the most respected U.S. senators from either party, Republican Susan Collins of Maine, admits that she could easily find herself casting her ballot this year for her former U.S. Senate colleague, Democrat Hillary Clinton, rather than her party's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when former California Republican gubernatorial candidate and Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman claims not only will she would never vote for Donald Trump, but she considers him no better than a fascist.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when his most ardent defender on CNN News, Jeffrey Lord, was so over the top in trying to make the case that Trump had not made racist comments, that his lame defense became a national story of its own.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble when yet a second passionate defender, Katrina Pierson, made the ultimate faux pas of claiming the Indiana judge, whose parents immigrated legally from Mexico decades ago, was a member of a partisan anti-Trump group called National Council of La Raza when in fact he was a member of the California La Raza Lawyers Association, a nonpartisan legal organization. Oops.Finally, Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for President because it seems the only three ways for him to win this election are:1. Either for a majority of this year's voters turn out to be 60-plus years old, white, high-school-educated men.2. Republicans can massively suppress the vote in a half dozen key swing states.3.

strong impact on juvenile minds.By \"juvenile minds\" I am not referring to the intellectual capacity of those who might vote for The Donald. Well, not necessarily.Nope, I mean my grandkids, who range in age from 4 to 10, proud possessors of juvenile minds but not registered Republicans.During a recent visit to my place they were gaga for America's great imposter.Though many adults no longer find the prospect of a Trump presidency so amusing, my grandkids would crack up at the mere mention of his name.It seemed every cloud looked like Donald Trump's face, every sunset was the colour of his hair (as if that hue could be found in nature). A knot in a plank might resemble his squinty grimace.Last summer, picking up on a careless utterance by their grandfather, they yelled \"I'm an idiot!\" while plunging off the dock into chilly lake waters. This summer it has been \"Donald\u00a0Trump!\" which amounts to roughly the same thing, I guess.At bedtime, they inserted Donald Trump into their readings of Curious George stories and, perhaps appropriately, books titled The Boy Who Ate the World and Too Many Toys.My grandkidlings have but a hazy idea of who Donald Trump is and what he stands for.I know that because not one of them woke up screaming with night terrors, sobbing \"Donald Trump\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0Donald Trump\" with such anguish that I had to rub their backs and reassure them that he might not be able to get us in Canada.But like comedians dropping the F-bomb, they know they can get a cheap laugh merely by uttering the name of that American national joke.Of course, there's a long tradition of children's innocent amusements being rooted in serious events of the day.For example, nursery rhymes often have a deeper, darker meaning.Ring Around a Rosie is about the black plague, apparently.Oranges and Lemons traces the route of a condemned man whose head is then chopped off.Mary Mary Quite Contrary refers to the tortures inflicted on Protestants by England's Queen Mary l. The silver bells in her garden of pain are thumbscrews. The cockle shells attach to other appendages.Humpty Dumpty was a large cannon used by the army of Charles l. When singing your infant to sleep with Rock-a-Bye Baby you might be suggesting that the heir to the throne of King James ll is somebody else's child.Anyway, my 10-year-old was the instigator of this summer's trumpery at my place.But it soon filtered down the grandchildren chain, as imitation seems to do every summer when these youngsters get together.Each tried to trump the other, so to speak.The climactic moment, our equivalent to Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican Convention, came around the bonfire one night.The kids, in not-so-flattering imitation of their grandfather, were taking turns inventing \"scary\" stories.Most involved some gruesome creature swooping down and devouring children who are wearing, coincidentally, the same clothes that the real children who were listening had just daubed with marshmallows.Our four-year-old, who has mastered the format if not the plot elements of the bonfire ghost story, climbed up on the stump that looks like a decaying alligator corpse and took his turn.\"Once there was an evil man and he snuck up on the bonfire and he came after a girl in brown and a boy in green and a boy in red and a grandpa drinking a beer\" - I may be misquoting him here - \"and captured them and took them away.\"\"And his name was DONALD TWUMP!\" While the rest of us we were all collapsed with laughter, I think the little guy helped himself to an extra piece of smore chocolate.Maybe he knows more about Trump than I was giving him credit for.GRANDPARENTS often tell each other that if they'd known how much fun grandparenting was going to be they would have skipped being parents.Caring for kids is a lot of responsibility. That's especially true for those of us who grandparent on our own and can't just dump the kids on a partner whenever it grows tiresome.But the ultimate responsibility for children usually rests with parents. No one's likely to blame me if one of my grandkids grows up to be a politician instead of a productive member of society.After sharing notes with other grandparents, I've concluded a big part of the joy of grandparenting lies in the anticipation.We look forward to their coming. We look forward to their finally falling asleep. We look forward to their departure. And then, when we've caught up on our sleep and cleaned up the mess, we start looking forward to their next visit. During intervals when we don't see them, we look forward to how they will have grown and what new skills they will have developed.Parents, on the other hand, have the kids almost all the time. They might get to anticipate the arrival of their children only before they are born and their departure only when applying for a bank loan for tuition.Their next moment of anticipation after that might be when junior moves back into their basement after seven years of study.That's unless they have grandparents handy. Despatching the kids to grandpa's or grandma's house periodically gives parents a chance to appreciate how much their young ones are changing and to look forward to having them back.Or, in thankfully rare cases, to move without leaving a forwarding address.We grandparents are the plover birds to their crocodiles, feeding ourselves while they get their teeth cleaned.And if parents have to wean their kids of a few bad habits and a sugar dependency when they return home, I'd say that's a small price to pay.Email hathcharm@gmail. com to contact Tom Mills. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

legacy in New York City is the stuff of myth: an outsized stamp on real estate characterized by a blend of self-aggrandizement and undeniable tenacity.The GOP front-runner's name is seemingly everywhere in the Big Apple, from Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue to Trump Place on the West Side; there's Trump World Tower near the United Nations, and the Trump International Hotel and Tower at the southwest corner of Central Park. That's not to mention Wollman Rink and the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point in the Bronx.\u00a0Yet, Trump represents \"an ascension of ego, of surface, and of explicitly catering to new wealth,\" said Matthew Lasner, co-editor of \"Affordable Housing in New York,\" who dubbed The Donald \"the Gordon Gekko of developers.\"His real estate career largely parallels NYC's shift from a family friendly haven for the middle class into a gold-plated grotto for the world's wealthy, contends Thomas J. Campanella, city and regional planning professor at Cornell University and author of the upcoming book, \"Brooklyn: A Secret History.\"While Fred Trump, \"the Henry Ford of Housing,\" made his fortune building thousands of \"wonderful and very affordable\" homes for the working class throughout Queens and Brooklyn, \"The Donald\" opted to ply his father's craft by erecting luxury accommodations in Manhattan that appeal to the moneyed international jet set, Campanella said.\"It's very ironic,\" said Campanella, noting that the affordable homes built by the elder Trump and subsequently snapped up by blue collar and city workers \"were built to last. The quality of their construction was extraordinary compared to what is built today.\"Unlike his father's sturdy, enduring, modest accommodations, Donald's buildings \"have not aged that well\" architecturally, said Campanella, describing them as distinctly \"late 80s,\" and painfully gaudy.Nonetheless, Trump's successes throughout his local career demonstrate a real proficicency in what he has famously deemed \"the art of the deal,\" according to Tom Angotti, author of \"New York for Sale,\" and a professor of urban affairs and planning at the CUNY Graduate Center.And then there are the civic efforts.In 1986, Trump offered to rebuild Wollman Rink in Central Park after the city suffered six years of setbacks and cost overruns. Last year, he opened the public golf club in the Bronx after a decade of struggles preceded him. Both locales charge significant fees.The Trump presidential campaign did not respond to an emailed request for comment.While Lasner said he is not sentimental about what Trump's buildings replaced (\"all buildings look good for 10 years, terrible for 30 years and then they're historic\") he noted that some of Trump's behavior as a developer \"represents a lack of public spiritedness.\"Instead of giving the historic art deco friezes on the Fifth Avenue Bonwit building to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which wanted them for its sculpture garden, for example, Trump destroyed them to make way for Trump Tower. The Trump Organization contended that the two-ton panels were \"without artistic merit,\" and would cost $500,000 to save, according to a story in the New York Times.While Trump is just a \"footnote to the city's overall development,\" Lasner says, his bombast looms large. Almost from the time the 69-year-old joined his father's business in the late 1960s, Trump has been a major cultural presence in the city.\"He has that New York attitude,\" notes Marco Mendez, 43, who lives in Trump's native Jamaica Estates.There are the innocuous scenes: starring in commercials, making cameos in movies, dressing in drag with Rudy Giuliani for an Inner Circle roast, hosting \"Saturday Night Live\" and launching \"The Apprentice.\"And there are other moments that stand more controversially, most notably when he put out ads in the New York Daily News calling for the death penalty to be re-instituted for the \"Central Park Five\" teens falsely accused of the brutal rape of a jogger in April 1989.(With Ann W.

Related:  Paul Ryan offers to step down as GOP convention chair if Donald Trump asksRubio, who in March ended his campaign for the party's nomination, made it abundantly clear that he was not at all interested in being drafted in as Trump pick for vice-president. In a Facebook post Rubio wrote: \"I have never sought, will not seek and do not want to be considered for vice-president.\"\u00a0\"[Trump] will be best served by a running mate and by surrogates who fully embrace his campaign. \"While Republican voters have chosen Donald Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee, my previously stated reservations about his campaign and concerns with many of his policies remain unchanged.\"Rubio, who bowed out of the presidential race after being routed by Donald Trump in the Florida primary, said he was focused on his job in the Senate. Anxiety over Donald Trump spread among congressional Republicans on Monday, pushing several to follow House Speaker Paul Ryan's lead and withhold their support from the divisive billionaire. Ryan himself declared there was no point in trying to \"fake\" party unity. \"If we go forward pretending that we're unified, then we are going to be at half-strength this fall,\" Ryan told the Journal Times in Racine, Wisconsin, defending his decision to refuse to endorse his party's presumptive presidential nominee.Still, in interviews with home-state reporters Monday, Ryan denounced the idea of any Republican launching a third-party or independent candidacy to challenge Trump, telling the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel it \"would be a disaster for our party\".Ryan said he would step aside from the House Speaker's traditional role as chairman of the Republican National Convention if Trump wanted him to, a scenario that Trump has left open.\"He's the nominee. I'll do whatever he wants in respect to the convention,\" Ryan said.The comments from Ryan and Trump came as both men prepared for a face-to-face meeting Thursday, which Republican leaders hope will begin to mend the fabric of their party. But other Republicans have also sought to distance themselves from Trump.Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, one of the most endangered Senate Republicans, wrote an opinion piece in the Philadelphia Inquirer drawing back from his long-stated intent to back the GOP nominee.Toomey said he was \"inclined to support the nominee\" of his party but wrote of Trump: \"His vulgarity, particularly toward women, is appalling. His lack of appreciation for constitutional limits on executive powers is deeply concerning... In short I find his candidacy highly problematic,\" Toomey wrote of Trump. \"There could come a point at which the differences are so great as to be irreconcilable.\"Trump has shrugged off the need for unity heading into the November general election and a likely match-up against Democrat Hillary Clinton, even though that would be the goal in any normal election year after a candidate effectively clinches the nomination, as Trump has done. \"I think this is a time for unity. And if there's not going to be unity, I think that's OK, too,\" Trump said on Fox Business Network. \"I mean, I'll go out and I think I'll do very well. I think I'm going to win the race either way.\"                     With the Associated Press                   ", "clean_text2": "marco rubio former republican presidenti hope rule join donald trump run mate relat paul ryan offer step gop convent chair donald trump asksrubio march end campaign parti nomin made abund clear interest draft trump pick vice presid facebook post rubio wrote never sought seek want consid vice presid trump best serv run mate surrog fulli embrac campaign republican voter chosen donald trump presumpt gop nomine previous state reserv campaign concern mani polici remain unchang rubio bow presidenti race rout donald trump florida primari said focus job senat anxieti donald trump spread among congression republican monday push sever follow hous speaker paul ryan lead withhold support divis billionair ryan declar point tri fake parti uniti go forward pretend unifi go half strength fall ryan told journal time racin wisconsin defend decis refus endors parti presumpt presidenti nomine still interview home state report monday ryan denounc idea republican launch third parti independ candidaci challeng trump tell milwauke journal sentinel would disast parti ryan said would step asid hous speaker tradit role chairman republican nation convent trump want scenario trump left open nomine whatev want respect convent ryan said comment ryan trump came men prepar face face meet thursday republican leader hope begin mend fabric parti republican also sought distanc trump pennsylvania senat pat toomey one endang senat republican wrote opinion piec philadelphia inquir draw back long state intent back gop nomine toomey said inclin support nomine parti wrote trump vulgar particular toward women appal lack appreci constitut limit execut power deepli concern short find candidaci high problemat toomey wrote trump could come point differ great irreconcil trump shrug need uniti head novemb general elect like match democrat hillari clinton even though would goal normal elect year candid effect clinch nomin trump done think time uniti go uniti think ok trump said fox busi network mean go think well think go win race either way associ press", "title": "Marco Rubio rules out joining Donald Trump as running mate; Florida senator cites strong reservations about Trump's campaign and policies - joining list of Republican figures declining to endorse presumptive nominee", "countNoStop": 314, "clean_text": "marco rubio former republican presidenti hope rule join donald trump run mate relat paul ryan offer step gop convent chair donald trump asksrubio march end campaign parti nomin made abund clear interest draft trump pick vice presid facebook post rubio wrote never sought seek want consid vice presid trump best serv run mate surrog fulli embrac campaign republican voter chosen donald trump presumpt gop nomine previous state reserv campaign concern mani polici remain unchang rubio bow presidenti race rout donald trump florida primari said focus job senat anxieti donald trump spread among congression republican monday push sever follow hous speaker paul ryan lead withhold support divis billionair ryan declar point tri fake parti uniti go forward pretend unifi go half strength fall ryan told journal time racin wisconsin defend decis refus endors parti presumpt presidenti nomine still interview home state report monday ryan denounc idea republican launch third parti independ candidaci challeng trump tell milwauke journal sentinel would disast parti ryan said would step asid hous speaker tradit role chairman republican nation convent trump want scenario trump left open nomine whatev want respect convent ryan said comment ryan trump came men prepar face face meet thursday republican leader hope begin mend fabric parti republican also sought distanc trump pennsylvania senat pat toomey one endang senat republican wrote opinion piec philadelphia inquir draw back long state intent back gop nomine toomey said inclin support nomine parti wrote trump vulgar particular toward women appal lack appreci constitut limit execut power deepli concern short find candidaci high problemat toomey wrote trump could come point differ great irreconcil trump shrug need uniti head novemb general elect like match democrat hillari clinton even though would goal normal elect year candid effect clinch nomin trump done think time uniti go uniti think ok trump said fox busi network mean go think well think go win race either way associ press", "byline": "Staff and agencies", "countWithStop": 569, "index": "42 of 1000 DOCUMENTS"}, "5": {"date": "March 3, 2016 Thursday", "countNoCusStop": 105, "text": "Ted Cruz managed a critical win in his home state of Texas over Trump, and another in Oklahoma and Alaska.\u00a0Bernie Sanders defeated Clinton in four states: Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont.Republican Marco Rubio notched his first victory of the campaign, taking the Minnesota caucus.

I know we've been on this path for a long time, but it's still hard getting your head around the idea, isn't it? Just to ease the transition, our first-ever exclusively Donald Trump quiz:  1) After his big string of victories this week, Trump appeared on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe,'' where he was asked who his foreign policy advisers were. He said:\u00a0  A) ''I'm speaking with a lot of generals. Very impressive people. All winners.''  B) ''I'm speaking with myself.''  C) ''I have a long list. It's a good list. Vladimir Putin said it was the best list he'd ever seen.''  2) After making his surprise endorsement, Ben Carson said that there were ''two different Donald Trumps'' and that the private one was ''very cerebral.'' Asked about that comment, Trump replied:  A) ''I think there are two Donald Trumps.''  B) ''I don't think there are two Donald Trumps.''  C) ''I think there are two Donald Trumps ... I don't think there are two Donald Trumps.''  3) Trump claimed on ''Good Morning America'' that there was ''nobody that's done so much for equality as I have.'' As an example he pointed to:  A) His endorsements by Mike Tyson and Dennis Rodman.  B) The black guy who won ''The Apprentice'' in 2005.  C) His $100,000-membership club, Mar-a-Lago -- ''totally open to everybody.''  4) After a protester rushed the stage at one of his rallies, Trump claimed the man was associated with ISIS, and retweeted a video of him holding a gun in front of the ISIS flag. When NBC's Chuck Todd pointed out that it was a hoax, Trump said:  A) ''Whoops.''  B) ''All I know is what's on the Internet.''  C) ''As Kierkegaard said, 'The truth is a trap.'''  5) One of the groups that's been opening Trump rallies is USA Freedom Kids, little girls who sang about ''President Trump'' who ''knows how to make America great ...  A) ''... And give us schools that really rate.''  B) ''... Teach us to love and not to hate.''  C) ''... Deal from strength or get crushed every time.''  6) Trump defended the supporter who sucker-punched a protester being led away by security forces. He said the attack was justified because the protester:  A) Had violently attacked an elderly woman.  B) Had tried to grab one of the officer's guns.  C) Was ''sticking a certain finger up in the air.''  7) House Speaker Paul Ryan scored a great triumph at the end of 2015 when the House passed a compromise spending bill that keeps the government running through the fall. Trump has been loudly critical, and at a recent rally in North Carolina, he said the bill was bad because:  A) ''The appropriation for infrastructure repair is inadequate.''  B) ''It fails to address the really critical Puerto Rican oil export issue.''  C) ''It funds ISIS.''  8) Sarah Palin had to leave the Trump campaign to be with her husband, who had a serious snowmobile accident. Before her departure she said Todd's multiple injuries made her appreciate:  A) ''The skill of Alaskan emergency treatment centers.''  B) ''The time that we have to spend in doing something so worthy, and that's to get Donald J. Trump elected president.''  C) ''The stress my family has undergone due to my unflagging pursuit of celebrity.''  9) After Trump defended the use of torture against suspected terrorists, his son Eric, who was campaigning for him, pointed out that waterboarding:  A) ''Is no different than what happens on college campuses in frat houses every day.''  B) ''Has real efficacy when employed as a last resort in isolated incidences.''  C) ''Is no worse than what China's doing to our manufacturing base.''  10) Since he threw his support behind Trump, Gov. Chris Christie has been humiliated on a daily basis for everything -- from his slavish stare at the candidate's press conferences to widespread criticism of his absence from New Jersey while he toils on the campaign trail. To pay him back, at a pre-primary event this week, Trump:  A) Made fun of Christie for the absentee thing.  B) Announced he was indeed planning to make Christie secretary of transportation.  C) Invited Christie to tell the audience about all the things he went through on 9/11.  11) Trump has endlessly complained about the way immigrants steal jobs from American workers, but he's used loopholes in federal law to hire foreign workers himself. At a recent debate he argued that voters wouldn't care about that seeming contradiction because:  A) ''Everybody would like a Romanian helper.''  B) ''Nobody knows the system better than me.''  C) ''What happens in Mar-a-Lago stays in Mar-a-Lago.''

Russian President Vladimir Macchiavelli Putin is invading countries as he pleases, stifling dissidents and accused of killing those who oppose him! And comedian Donald Trump says that Vladimir Putin is 'worthy of admiration'! But Donald Trump also sneers at women, the disabled, blacks, Mexicans, Muslims, war veterans and anyone who is unattractive.

During a visit with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump was cordial, respectful, soft-spoken and extremely guarded in his words.\u00a0There's strong evidence that his new team of handlers have convinced Trump that his presidential prospects will continue to diminish unless his tone changes. That's good, provided he can keep it up. We worry that he can't, however, because of the speech the GOP candidate gave in Phoenix later Wednesday outlining the major tenets of his immigration enforcement plan.The speech was full of the standard Trump brashness and unsupported, broad-sweep characterizations. Particularly disappointing was his failure (again) to explain the cost and financing of his immigration plan.In Mexico City, Trump told reporters he and Pe\u00f1a Nieto did not discuss the single most repeated and most outlandish tenet of Trump's plan: building a wall across the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. Trump continues to insist Mexico will pay for it.If the topic didn't come up in the Mexico meeting, the fault was all Trump's. Did he lose his nerve once he sat face-to-face with the Mexican president? Did he somehow forget to bring it up?\"Who pays for the wall? We didn't discuss,\" Trump told reporters.Pe\u00f1a Nieto stated afterward that the issue did come up at the start of the meeting, and he \"made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\"In Phoenix Wednesday night, Trump invoked it as his top priority. \"On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border. ... and Mexico will pay for the wall,\" he stated.His obsession with this fantasy detracts from other aspects of Trump's immigration speech that actually are worthy of consideration. He correctly says, for example, that criminal aliens should be deported from the United States.That also happens to be the top enforcement priority of the Obama administration. Since 2009, the United States has deported more than 2 million unauthorized immigrants, more than a third of whom held criminal status.Trump is correct that the E-Verify program should be expanded to ensure that U.S. employers don't profit by evading laws designed to reduce the magnet appeal of illegal employment here.His plan to expand biometric screening also is worth consideration. Paying for it - plus the wall, plus his proposed 5,000 extra border enforcers, plus extra prison facilities to house potential deportees, plus the extra personnel and vehicles required to hunt down and expel 11 million unauthorized immigrants - is the big question.For a man so full of answers to America's biggest problems, Trump is awkwardly silent when it comes to that one.", "clean_text2": "donald trump display wednesday would immigr enforc chief unlik donald trump seen campaign visit mexican presid enriqu pe\u00f1a nieto trump cordial respect soft spoken extrem guard word strong evid new team handler convinc trump presidenti prospect continu diminish unless tone chang good provid keep worri howev speech gop candid gave phoenix later wednesday outlin major tenet immigr enforc plan speech full standard trump brash unsupport broad sweep character particular disappoint failur explain cost financ immigr plan mexico citi trump told report pe\u00f1a nieto discuss singl repeat outlandish tenet trump plan build wall across 2 000 mile u mexico border trump continu insist mexico pay topic come mexico meet fault trump lose nerv sat face face mexican presid somehow forget bring pay wall discuss trump told report pe\u00f1a nieto state afterward issu come start meet made clear mexico pay wall phoenix wednesday night trump invok top prioriti day one begin work impenetr physic wall southern border mexico pay wall state obsess fantasi detract aspect trump immigr speech actual worthi consider correct say exampl crimin alien deport unit state also happen top enforc prioriti obama administr sinc 2009 unit state deport 2 million unauthor immigr third held crimin status trump correct e verifi program expand ensur u employ profit evad law design reduc magnet appeal illeg employ plan expand biometr screen also worth consider pay plus wall plus propos 5 000 extra border enforc plus extra prison facil hous potenti deporte plus extra personnel vehicl requir hunt expel 11 million unauthor immigr big question man full answer america biggest problem trump awkward silent come one", "title": "Editorial: Trump's immigration plan talks about everything but the cost", "countNoStop": 263, "clean_text": "donald trump display wednesday would immigr enforc chief unlik donald trump seen campaign visit mexican presid enriqu pe\u00f1a nieto trump cordial respect soft spoken extrem guard word strong evid new team handler convinc trump presidenti prospect continu diminish unless tone chang good provid keep worri howev speech gop candid gave phoenix later wednesday outlin major tenet immigr enforc plan speech full standard trump brash unsupport broad sweep character particular disappoint failur explain cost financ immigr plan mexico citi trump told report pe\u00f1a nieto discuss singl repeat outlandish tenet trump plan build wall across 2 000 mile u mexico border trump continu insist mexico pay topic come mexico meet fault trump lose nerv sat face face mexican presid somehow forget bring pay wall discuss trump told report pe\u00f1a nieto state afterward issu come start meet made clear mexico pay wall phoenix wednesday night trump invok top prioriti day one begin work impenetr physic wall southern border mexico pay wall state obsess fantasi detract aspect trump immigr speech actual worthi consider correct say exampl crimin alien deport unit state also happen top enforc prioriti obama administr sinc 2009 unit state deport 2 million unauthor immigr third held crimin status trump correct e verifi program expand ensur u employ profit evad law design reduc magnet appeal illeg employ plan expand biometr screen also worth consider pay plus wall plus propos 5 000 extra border enforc plus extra prison facil hous potenti deporte plus extra personnel vehicl requir hunt expel 11 million unauthor immigr big question man full answer america biggest problem trump awkward silent come one", "byline": " By the Editorial Board ", "countWithStop": 478, "index": "53 of 1000 DOCUMENTS"}, "14": {"date": "May 20, 2016 Friday", "countNoCusStop": 161, "text": "'Christian' Trump supporters need to reread BibleIf you consider yourself to be a Bible-believing Christian and support Donald Trump, you should Google a fellow conservative Christian (or so he claims) named Ken Shupe.\u00a0 Mr. Shupe owns a towing business in Asheville, North Carolina, and was called to tow the car of a woman named Casey McWade who is arthritic and needed help.

You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.\"Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.\"I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,\" says Kimmel. \"Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.\"When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.\"I don't think he knew who I was,\" says Kimmel. \"I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.\"That was impressive, says Kimmel. \"I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.\"Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he \"immediately fell deeply in love\" with Montreal.\"It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.\"At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). \"We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,\" he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, \"played a lot of tennis back in his day.\"I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,\" says Kimmel. \"It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.\"One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.\"It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.\"Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get \"too inside\" by assuming that the audience has seen your show.\"I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting offon the wrong foot.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Sun Media Corporation.

Bush and George W. Bush; 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney; and scores of current or formally elected Republican leaders decide it's better to stay home watching the Cleveland Convention from the privacy of their bedrooms than to attend the event in person.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when one of the most respected U.S. Senators from either party, Republican Susan Collins of Maine, admits that she could easily find herself casting her ballot this year for her former U.S. Senate colleague, Democrat Hillary Clinton, rather than her party's presumptive nominee Donald Trump.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when former California Republican gubernatorial candidate and Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman claims not only will she would never vote for Donald Trump, but she considers him no better than a fascist.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when his most ardent defender on CNN News, Jeffrey Lord, was so over the top in trying to make the case that Trump had not made racist comments, that his lame defense became a national story of its own.Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble when yet a second passionate defender, Katrina Pierson, made the ultimate faux pas of claiming the Indiana judge, whose parents immigrated legally from Mexico decades ago, was a member of a partisan anti-Trump group called National Council of La Raza when in fact he was a member of the California La Raza Lawyers Association, a nonpartisan legal organization. Oops.Finally, Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for President because it seems the only three ways for him to win this election are:1. Either for a majority of this year's voters to turn out to be 60-plus years old, white, high-school-educated men.2. If Republicans can massively suppress the vote in a half dozen key swing states.3. He can pick up the support of disillusioned Bernie Sanders partisans, even though they disagree with him on abortion rights, the death penalty, gay marriage, global warming and immigration.Michael

Pollsters say the wealth-flaunting Trump's typical supporters are relatively poorly-educated white males. We saw a lot of them - and many women, too - at his campaign rallies, and footage of supporters turning, mob like, on protestors, including Muslims.Jibril told presenter Matt Frei what was at stake, while pointing out how people could become distracted by the pitiful excuse for a politician: \"In many ways he is a buffoon, but he is a buffoon who has to be taken seriously - he is close to getting the Republican nomination and close to becoming the American President.\"Frei pointed out that the buzz phrases of Barack Obama 's campaigning were \"Hope and change\" and \"Yes we can\" - while one of Trump's is \"We are going to build a wall\" (along the US-Mexico border). He added that, during a 90 minute rally, Trump \"leapfrogged from one half-baked idea to another - and yet they love it.\"Trump appears to have serious issues - including many with women. We heard from Selina Scott , whose TV profile of him upset his ego so much that he sent her about a dozen \"extremely abusive\" letters.

After a protester rushed the stage at one of his rallies, Trump claimed the man was associated with ISIS, and retweeted a video of him holding a gun in front of the ISIS flag. When NBC's Chuck Todd pointed out that it was a hoax, Trump said ...A. \"Whoops.\"B. \"All I know is what's on the Internet.\"C. \"As Kierkegaard said, 'The truth is a trap.'\"5. Trump defended the supporter who sucker-punched a protester being led away by security. He said the attack was justified because the protester ...A. Had violently attacked an elderly woman.B.

Related:  Paul Ryan offers to step down as GOP convention chair if Donald Trump asksRubio, who in March ended his campaign for the party's nomination, made it abundantly clear that he was not at all interested in being drafted in as Trump pick for vice-president. In a Facebook post Rubio wrote: \"I have never sought, will not seek and do not want to be considered for vice-president.\"\u00a0\"[Trump] will be best served by a running mate and by surrogates who fully embrace his campaign. \"While Republican voters have chosen Donald Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee, my previously stated reservations about his campaign and concerns with many of his policies remain unchanged.\"Rubio, who bowed out of the presidential race after being routed by Donald Trump in the Florida primary, said he was focused on his job in the Senate. Anxiety over Donald Trump spread among congressional Republicans on Monday, pushing several to follow House Speaker Paul Ryan's lead and withhold their support from the divisive billionaire. Ryan himself declared there was no point in trying to \"fake\" party unity. \"If we go forward pretending that we're unified, then we are going to be at half-strength this fall,\" Ryan told the Journal Times in Racine, Wisconsin, defending his decision to refuse to endorse his party's presumptive presidential nominee.Still, in interviews with home-state reporters Monday, Ryan denounced the idea of any Republican launching a third-party or independent candidacy to challenge Trump, telling the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel it \"would be a disaster for our party\".Ryan said he would step aside from the House Speaker's traditional role as chairman of the Republican National Convention if Trump wanted him to, a scenario that Trump has left open.\"He's the nominee. I'll do whatever he wants in respect to the convention,\" Ryan said.The comments from Ryan and Trump came as both men prepared for a face-to-face meeting Thursday, which Republican leaders hope will begin to mend the fabric of their party. But other Republicans have also sought to distance themselves from Trump.Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, one of the most endangered Senate Republicans, wrote an opinion piece in the Philadelphia Inquirer drawing back from his long-stated intent to back the GOP nominee.Toomey said he was \"inclined to support the nominee\" of his party but wrote of Trump: \"His vulgarity, particularly toward women, is appalling. His lack of appreciation for constitutional limits on executive powers is deeply concerning... In short I find his candidacy highly problematic,\" Toomey wrote of Trump. \"There could come a point at which the differences are so great as to be irreconcilable.\"Trump has shrugged off the need for unity heading into the November general election and a likely match-up against Democrat Hillary Clinton, even though that would be the goal in any normal election year after a candidate effectively clinches the nomination, as Trump has done. \"I think this is a time for unity. And if there's not going to be unity, I think that's OK, too,\" Trump said on Fox Business Network. \"I mean, I'll go out and I think I'll do very well.

When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.\"Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been \"a gift from the comedy gods.\" He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.\"He does two crazy things every day,\" says Kimmel. \"Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.\"Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.\"I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,\" says Kimmel. \"Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.\"When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.\"I don't think he knew who I was,\" says Kimmel. \"I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.\"That was impressive, says Kimmel. \"I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.\"Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he \"immediately fell deeply in love\" with Montreal.\"It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.\"At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). \"We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,\" he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, \"played a lot of tennis back in his day.\"I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,\" says Kimmel. \"It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.\"One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.\"It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.\"Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get \"too inside\" by assuming that the audience has seen your show.\"I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting offon the wrong foot.\"", "clean_text2": "enough donald trump rob ford comparison say jimmi kimmel talk show host montreal past week laugh comedi festiv judg jeffross present roast battl avail stream thecomedynetwork ca like comedian drew line compar republican presidenti candid late toronto mayor canadian like say say kimmel let forget rob ford smoke crack donald trump pick crack pipe comparison kimmel conced like ford trump gift comedi god theori campaign billionair seem get away one outrag statement anoth two crazi thing everi day say kimmel noth stick keep stuff even focus one five clock afternoon done someth els kimmel sadden news ford pass former mayor toronto die march 22 age 46 ford brother doug flown los angel appear jimmi kimmel live 2014 get know get know brother say kimmel whatev want say guy realli care mayor realli care good job obvious demon ford land los angel intern airport en rout kimmel show host dress chauffeur pick limo think knew say kimmel rememb spent whole car ride phone call back constitu left phone messag impress say kimmel wish spirit would somehow fill pothol drive work kimmel made first appear laugh 19 year ago say immedi fell deepli love montreal hard peopl america understand restaur turn nightclub end meal usual dessert go home restaur move tabl start danc 48 kimmel one veteran player late night scene enter 14th season host jimmi kimmel live weeknight comedi network work much harder anyon ever use say suggest one idol johnni carson play lot tenni back day think ruin job everyon ad viral video sketch mix say kimmel use reason job could go home 6 clock night think show next day definit chang one kimmel sketch play week facebook youtub song danc number star matthew broderick nathan lane liken trump campaign broadway farc produc look like took day shoot kimmel say pull togeth afternoon make realiz much money wast make movi put someth togeth quick kimmel next challeng come sept 18 host emmi award air abc ctv trick host award show say get insid assum audienc seen show think approach show instead show host automat get offon wrong foot", "title": "The gifts that keep on giving;

Nothing demonstrates this quite like so many commentators having egg on their faces for mistakenly predicting its demise.The only reason I don't is that I have never underestimated the ignorance or gullibility of large segments of the American people. Such commentaries as \"On Syria (and almost Every Other Issue), the American People are Insolent, Ignorant, Idiots,\" September 10, 2013, attest to this.Nearly 10 percent of college graduates in the United States think that TV host Judith 'Judge Judy' Sheindlin sits on the Supreme Court, according to a recent study.(New York Post, January 19, 2016)\u00a0See? And that percent is probably five times higher among non-grads and high-school dropouts. In other words, this Trump phenomenon says more about far too many Americans than it does about him.Donald Trump is nothing more than the P.T. Barnum of business: a huckster who thrives on the maxim that 'there's a sucker born every minute'...The only people who think Trump would make a good president are the suckers to whom he could sell swampland in the Florida Everglades as beachfront property.(\"Trump for President? Don't Be a Sucker,\" The iPINIONS Journal, April 8, 2011)Which brings me to the evangelicals and their incomprehensible support. I know evangelicals. As the son of an evangelical preacher, I grew up amongst them. So trust me when I say that, for any sober evangelical, Trump is the very personification of Mammon.This, after all, is a man who takes diabolical pride in boasting that he never asks God for forgiveness because he's without sin; he's rich; and he's like a god himself. He even boasts that The Art of the Deal, his book about the virtues of greed and the salvation of wealth, rivals the Bible.Not to mention that he made most of his money building gambling casinos. Because gambling is as great a sin for most evangelicals as usury is for most Islamists.But Trump is probably best known for building a gilded tower in New York City as a monument to himself. And, given his delusions of grandeur, one could well imagine him challenging Jesus by channeling the Devil from atop that tower as follows:Finally, the Devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 'If You bow down and worship me,' he said, 'I will give You all of this.'(Matthew 4:8)Of course, Jesus rebuked and then admonished the Devil to humble himself before God. You'd think evangelicals would do what Jesus did, especially given that Trump challenges their Christian faith almost every day. Instead of rebuking and admonishing him, however, they invariably hail him as if he were, well, the second coming of Jesus Christ.This was the case yesterday, when he held a rally at their Gethsemane, Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. Trump has an infamous and unrepentant record of iniquity; therefore, one might have expected evangelicals there to give him a proverbial stoning. Instead, they behaved as if Trump had channeled Daniel in the lion's den and cast a spell on them.Incidentally, this, from the conservative news site World Net Daily (on August 15, 2015), might explain why Trump is wooing evangelicals so successfully:President Obama isn't the Antichrist -- but he sure is 'paving the way' for him, said some Christian evangelists who've been watching the White House in biblically prophetic light with alarm.(WND, August 15, 2015)As it happened, Trump betrayed that he just might be the Antichrist when he bit his tongue trying to read a scripture from the Bible:After vowing to protect Christians across the globe, Trump read a verse from Second Corinthians -- one of the books in the New Testament. But Trump flubbed the name, pronouncing it 'Two Corinthians.'(AOL News, January 18, 2016)As he does with everything, Trump boasts about the love evangelicals have for him. But they have clearly lost their way. It's a testament to just how far that more evangelicals are filling stadiums to hear Trump boast about his wealth than are filling churches to hear pastors preach about their God.The only thing that explains this willful suspension of their evangelical faith is the precedent the lost Israelites set in Bible times:Exodus 32 relates that the Israelites, anxious about Moses' prolonged absence, demanded that provide a god to lead them. Complying, Aaron collected the golden ornaments of the people and fashioned the gold into the shape of a calf...The image was immediately hailed by the people as a representation of the God who had brought Israel out of Egypt.(Jewish Virtual Library.org)Trump is brazenly exploiting his \"relationship\" with evangelicals for all it's worth. Never mind that their relationship is based primarily on Trump boasting about his wealth and evangelicals hailing it as a representation of the God who will help Trump lead them down the primrose path.Again, it would be one thing if Trump troubled himself to show a little regard for their purported Christian values. But the feature attraction of his campaign rhetoric is mean-spirited, bullying, even profane language, which makes a mockery of those values.To be fair, some evangelicals are more political conservatives than religious fanatics. But Trump, the New York liberal masquerading as a conservative, should be just as much a heathen as Trump, the apocalyptic Antichrist masquerading as a fanatic.Which is why all evangelicals in this context are sacrificing their political ideology and/or Christian faith at the altar of Trump's egomaniacal ambition. And this does not even address the sacrilege inherent in Trump comparing himself to Ronald Reagan. After all, Reagan is like a god to political conservatives and religious fanatics alike, which is also incomprehensible. But I digress.The point is that, evangelicals seem drunk with wonder as they hang on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Trump. But I am constrained to ask: What will it profit an evangelical if he gains Trump as president, but loses his own soul?In a similar vein, Trump would do well to heed this admonition ... from God Himself:Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.(Mathew 19:24)Evangelicals have always intoned that character matters. They would do well to be guided by this admonition when choosing a candidate to enter the White House.Related commentaries:American people...Trump for president...* This commentary was originally

"Enough with all the Donald Trump and Rob Ford comparisons, says Jimmy Kimmel.The talk show host was in Montreal this past week for the Just for Laughs comedy festival and to be a judge on JeffRoss Presents Roast Battle (available for streaming at thecomedynetwork. ca).Like a few other comedians, he drew the line at comparing the Republican presidential candidate to the late Toronto mayor.\u00a0\"Canadians like to say that,\" says Kimmel, \"but let's not forget that Rob Ford was smoking crack. When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.\"Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been \"a gift from the comedy gods.\" He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.\"He does two crazy things every day,\" says Kimmel. \"Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.\"Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.\"I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,\" says Kimmel. \"Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about beingmayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.\"When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.\"I don't think he knew who I was,\" says Kimmel. \"I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.\"That was impressive, says Kimmel. \"I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.\"Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he \"immediately fell deeply in love\" with Montreal.\"It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables andstart dancing.\"At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). \"We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,\" he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, \"played a lot of tennis back in his day.\"I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,\" says Kimmel. \"It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.\"One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.\"It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.\"Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get \"too inside\" by assuming that the audience has seen your show.\"I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting offon the wrong foot.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Hillary Clinton has already widened her gap with the Republican candidate by double digits. Hillary Clinton has 49 per cent against Donald Trump's 39 per cent in the latest Fox news polls with many other polls showing bigger gaps.The Republican Party could have spared itself from getting seriously worried about Hillary Clinton's lead even though it is more than its comfort zone because, with nearly 100 days left until the election, time is not against it to catch up. Normally, both political parties gain a few percentage points after their respective Conventions. The Republican Party could have explained to itself Hillary Clinton's good showing in the polls as the outcome of the Democratic Party's successful Convention and move ahead.\u00a0But the widening gap is not the major worry of the Republican Party. Donald Trump has finally landed himself and the Party into a black hole that many, even some in the Republican Party itself, had expected all along. But, the Party bullied by the candidate did not dare to confront him earlier to stop him from winning the ticket. Donald Trump did not just bully his way to the top of the Republican Party, on the way he insulted some of the crucial groups that would decide the fate of the election, as for instance, the Hispanics/Latin voters and women.The Republican Party leadership did not confront Donald Trump because it had hoped that once he became the nominee, he would sober down and reach out beyond his narrow base of extreme right and white blue-collar workers towards the national constituencies. The leadership had also hoped that he would extend his hand to the Party after becoming the candidate as they thought it inconceivable that a candidate could hope to win a presidential election by insulting and bullying his own Party leaders and telling them to submit to him or to get lost.The Republican Party in dismay found that their hopes were totally misplaced because Donald Trump is more than a bully. They also realised what President Obama had pointed out in his speech at the Democratic Convention - that Donald Trump is neither a Republican nor a conservative. Perhaps the Party could still have found some ways to adjust with Donald Trump had he not picked the feud with the Gold Star parents Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala Khan whose son Captain Humayun Khan was killed in Iraq in 2004 and the way he handled it thereafter. (Parents who have lost a son/daughter fighting for the USA are proudly referred to a Gold Star parents).Khizr Khan had in his powerful statement at the Democratic Convention said certain things about Donald Trump that he should not have. He questioned Donald Trump's sacrifice for his country and also further questioned if he had read the Constitution. But for someone seeking the highest political office who had insulted everyone or every group he wanted or felt would be helpful for his objectives, Donald Trump did not show the minimum of tolerance. He also did not show decency by the way he insulted Khizr Khan's wife. He also failed to realise the consequences of insulting individuals proudly respected by all Americans on a bipartisan basis.Instead as he has done ever since he entered the race, Donald Trump chose to bully and insult the Gold Star parents instead of giving himself some time to respond to Khizr Khan's accusations. If he had done that without the insults, he may even have scored some points. But Khizr Khan had touched Donald Trump's narcissist character and humungous ego and exposed the worst in his character, his knack for insulting people at will over which he has no control. In the process, he also exposed his utter lack of temperament to lead the country together with his bullying nature and cruel and insulting ways towards Gold Star parents.The feud shocked the nation and angered his own party leaders whom he had already bullied and insulted beyond limits. Thus not one of these leaders uttered one word to defend him. Many were openly critical of him and ashamed of what he had done. Sally Bradshaw, a leading Republican from Florida, in disgust left the Party. The reasons she gave for her decision were significant because in these she has articulated the dangers for America in electing Donald Trump. She said that the Republican Party is \" at a crossroads and have nominated a total narcissist -- a misogynist -- a bigot.\" She further added: \"This is a time when country has to take priority over political parties. Donald Trump cannot be elected president.\"It is obvious to almost everyone in the country that Donald Trump has hit political dynamite with the Khans - to everyone except Donald Trump and his inner circle, of course. When it required calm and intelligent response for managing the devastating consequences, his campaign team went to ABC's George Stephanopoulos for damage control. That was like sending the lamb to the slaughterhouse. George Stephanopoulos, once a top aide of President Bill Clinton, clinically destroyed Donald Trump, the candidate.George Stephanopoulos encouraged Donald Trump to equate his building buildings and creating jobs to Gazala Khan's sacrificing her son for the service of the nation. He trapped Donald Trump to insult Gazala Khan more, describing her as someone dumb who has no views. And George Stephanopoulos finally led Donald Trump up the garden path into foreign affairs where he exposed him as one who did not even know that the Russians had invaded Ukraine in 2014 and had annexed Crimea!The post-Khizr Khan-Donald Trump feud has brought American voters face-to-face with the question whether they could have some one as President with such lack of temperament and other negative character traits with the Football and the Biscuit. The Football is the code name for the 45-pound briefcase that contains the country's nuclear codes that remain by the side of the President 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year and one the outgoing President carries to the inaugural of the new President to hand it over to him/her. The Biscuit is code name for the personal identifier that allows the President to open the Football and launch USA's nuclear weapons either to defend the country or as offensive weapons.In the case of a nuclear attack on the United States, the President's reaction time is six (6) minutes if the attack came from the land of its known nuclear enemies and three (3) minutes, if the attacks were launched from submarines. In using USA's humungous arsenal of nuclear weapons, its fate and with it, the world's, is inexplicably placed in the hands of its President. He alone is empowered to decide to launch US' nuclear weapons because in the three and six minutes he has for response, he has no way to consult anyone else! On his campaign trail, Donald Trump has questioned why the US keeps its nuclear arsenal if it does not use them and has urged Japan and South Korea to go nuclear.Americans are thus deeply worried about Donald Trump becoming President because of serious doubts about his temperament. His own Party leaders more than others are now exploring ways to replace him. Meanwhile, as polls show the gap between him and Hillary Clinton widening, Donald Trump is totally oblivious of it as he is of the dangerous and developing consequences of his feud with Khizr Khan and his wife. Instead, he has asked his supporters not to believe in the polls because he is leading Hillary Clinton by substantial numbers and that the Party has never been so united as it is now - the claims that are raising questions in many minds if he is \"plain crazy\".As if he has sensed his future in the polls, Donald Trump has asked his supporters in a recent rally to be prepared for massive vote rigging against him. This raving only enhanced the concern in the country over the prospects of the Football and the Biscuit being in the possession of such a person if he ever became the President.The writer is a retired Ambassador.ambserajulislam@gmail.comPublished by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

Trump was rarely mentioned by name, though U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st District, did take a line from the rich businessman when he said, \"We can make this nation great again.\"In the end, the more than 200 1st District Republicans in attendance elected three national delegates who unabashedly backed the presidential candidacy of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who suspended his campaign last week.\u00a0Stafford County resident Steve Albertson, Spotsylvania County resident Laurie Tryfiates and Prince William County Supervisor Jeanine Lawson won the delegate slots for the national convention, which will be held July 18-21 in Cleveland.Of the three, only Lawson mentioned Trump by name during her remarks to attendees. \"Folks, Donald Trump is right--we have to make America great again,\" she said, adding that \"it is imperative that we unify because Hillary Clinton is an unacceptable choice for our nation.\"Meanwhile, unsuccessful delegate candidate Adam Washington of Stafford received moderate applause after asking the audience, \"So who's ready to stump for Trump and make America great again?\"Albertson said he thinks it will take time for some Cruz supporters to get behind Trump, though he added, \"I do think we'll come around.\" He said many Republicans are committed to what he called \"well-defined principles\" but \"have some doubt about Trump being the standard-bearer\" for those beliefs.Tryfiates, who wore a button reading \"I'm a pro-life Republican,\" said \"there are a few positive signs that are happening in the Trump campaign\" such as his hiring of a conservative policy director.\"But I think a lot of conservatives are looking to see more from the presumptive nominee,\" she said, calling Cruz a \"proven conservative.\"Cruz out-organized Trump in recruiting delegates, drawing the ire of many of the rich businessman's supporters. But the Cruz loyalists probably won't play a factor at the national convention now that Trump is expected to clinch the nomination on the first ballot.Notables at the 1st District convention included former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore--who unsuccessfully sought the GOP presidential nomination--state Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania and House Speaker Bill Howell, R-Stafford.Very few of the attendees sported Trump paraphernalia. Many wore orange \"guns save lives\" stickers that were distributed by the Virginia Citizens Defense League.Some former Republican presidential candidates, including Jeb Bush, have said they will not vote for Trump or Clinton. Gilmore received applause at the 1st District convention after calling that sentiment \"entirely disloyal.\"Prince William Supervisor Corey Stewart, the chairman of Trump's campaign in Virginia, told audience members that he knows a lot of them were disappointed by Cruz's loss. But he said four years of Clinton appointing Supreme Court justices is \"something a Republican cannot tolerate.\"He called the Democratic Party a \"big corrupt disgusting mass that is about to unravel at a very quick pace.\"\"And we can do that together if we stay together,\" Stewart said.Jeff Branscome: 540.374-5402jbranscome@freelancestar.com___ (c)2016 The Free Lance-Star (Fredericksburg, Va.)

cancellation was swift and harsh, leaving some Republicans backing the real estate mogul's opponents with renewed vigor ahead of Tuesday's primary vote.But Trump's campaign has been a direct assault on the so-called political establishment forces that were quick to condemn him, leaving it unclear what the long-term results of Trump's University of Illinois Chicago non-rally will be.\"Donald Trump created that hostile environment,\" said state Rep. Ed Sullivan, a Mundelein Republican and backer of Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\u00a0He predicted a backlash against Trump. But if there isn't one, Sullivan said, \"God help us.\"Conservative radio host and former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh was among those who was quick to retort. He has not formally backed a presidential candidate but has said he can relate to Trump's push against the Republican establishment.\"They didn't just cancel Trump's rally last night,\" Walsh posted to Twitter. \"They shut down speech. They spit on America. They awakened the silent majority.\"All of Trump's opponents on the Illinois primary ballot -- Kasich, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz criticized Trump swiftly after the cancellation was announced.But with their supporters split and not uniting behind a single alternative, it's unclear if any one of them will be able to overtake Trump's vote totals in Illinois or in Ohio or Florida where more convention delegates are at stake Tuesday.A protester at a Trump event at an airport hangar near Dayton, Ohio, on Saturday leapt over a barricade, jumping into the security buffer surrounding the stage from which Trump was speaking.Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer says Thomas Dimassimo of Fairborn, Ohio, has been charged with inducing panicand disorderly conduct.Dim assimo was stopped by several U.S. Secret Service agents and other officers, but not before making his way to the stage itself. Several Secret Service agents surrounded Trump on stage briefly while Dimassimo was detained and removed from the area.Speaking at a rally later Saturday in St. Lois, Trump told the crowd about the incident and said that, after learning the man's name, one of his \"Internet people\" discovered something shocking: alleged evidence that linked Dimassimo to Islamic State militants.\"It was probably ISIS or ISIS-related. Do you believe it?\" Trump asked the crowd. He said that an online search had revealed \"the guy is playing all sorts of, let's say music that you wouldn't be liking, dragging an American flag along the sidewalk, making all sorts of gestures, having all sorts of things on the Internet. And he's probably or possibly ISIS-related.\"Trump appeared to be referring to a video, which was posted on his official Twitter account, that shows student protesters stepping on American flags, declaring, \"Black Live Matters\" and talking to reporters while religious music plays. It appears to be an edited version of a video posted on YouTube in April 2015 captioned, \"Students at Wright State University #NotMyFlag protest.Hassan Hassan, the co-author of the book \"ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,\" says the video is \"definitely not an ISIS video\" based on its content.\"This is utterly farcical; the video is incontrovertibly fake and Trump's accusations about it being linked to ISIS serve only to underline the totality of his ignorance on this issue,\" said Charles Lister, a fellow at the Middle East Institute.But Saturday night in Kansas City, Missouri as protesters made their mark at his latest rally, Trump seemed to relish the interruptions -- repeatedly ridiculing them as people with a \"little weak voice\" and saying \"go home to mommy.\" Even while stirring up his boisterous supporters, he asked security to be \"very gentle\" when taking the protesters out. About 20 minutes into his remarks, more than a dozen demonstrators were escorted out.Meanwhile, at the St. Patrick's Day parade In Chicago on Saturday, Gov. Bruce Rauner made only brief remarks about the bedlam the night before.

John Kasich told reporters before a Saturday morning speech in Sharonville.\"Donald Trump has created a toxic environment,\" Kasich said. That \"toxic environment has allowed his supporters and those who sometimes seek confrontation to come together in violence. There is no place for this. There is no place for a national leader to prey on the fears of people who live in our great country.\"\u00a0\"It is important that we recognize their frustrations,\" Kasich said. \"It is important to recognize that there are challenges that we face -- challenges of job insecurity and a lack of rising wages, and a frustration that their children may not inherit the kind of life that they inherited from their parents. That is to be recognized. But it isn't to be used to drive people down -- it isn't used to divide people.\"\"If our rhetoric is negative, if our rhetoric is divisive, we will not solve these problems that the American people expect us to fix,\" he said.Trump apparently still has the governor's support if he becomes the party's nominee, although, \"It makes it extremely difficult,\" Kasich said.Kasich, at times angry and defiant, expressed disappointment with media coverage of the presidential campaign, and predicted that against uphill odds he will be the GOP nominee for president.\"What I would say to you is we'll see where this whole thing goes,\" Kasich said, when asked a second time if he would support Trump. \"I'm going to be the Republican nominee. I'm going to win Ohio, and do not be surprised if I go to the convention with the largest number of delegates. We have a thousand delegates yet to pick -- so don't be thinkin' that it isn't possible for me not to go there with great strength. Because it can happen.\"Other candidates finally are seeing the wisdom of taking the positive approach, Kasich said.\"I'm pleased to see that the other candidates in the last debate began to realize that name-calling, that lowering the bar on American politics is not acceptable,\" Kasich said. \"And I believe they have learned, at least in the last debate, that ideas matter, that vision matters, that policies matter, and giving people hope matters.\"\"Frankly, the coverage of this campaign has been disappointing,\" Kasich said. \"Because it seems as though the attention goes to those who call names. I refused to do it this entire campaign. Even if it meant that I would be ignored, even if it meant that I would lose.\"A day earlier, the other two GOP opponents of Trump had spoken out against violence at his rallies, while Kasich was silent when asked about it.\"Just to see Americans slugging themselves at a political rally deeply disturbed me. We're better than that. We're a nation that overcomes obstacles and challenges,\" Kasich said Saturday. \"I'm just reminded of when we worked together, in light of some terrible, terrible situations in Ohio, where we brought police and community together.\"He gave two reasons for his silence on Friday: First, he doesn't watch much TV news, he said.Also: \"You don't get down in the mud and wrestle. You have a broader vision,\" Kasich said. \"Now, yesterday, when they asked me about the violence, I didn't know what you were talking about, because I didn't see it. But I saw it last night, and put a statement up last night, and I'm sort of to the point where I've had enough of this.\"The biggest day in Kasich's campaign will be Tuesday, when Ohioans turn out for the GOP primary. He announced in late February that if he doesn't win his home state he will drop out of the race.Just up Interstate 75 from where Kasich gave his remarks at the Sharonville Convention Center on Saturday, Trump is expected to speak at 2 p.m. today at The Savannah Center, at 5533 Chappell Crossing Blvd., in West Chester.In a brash anti-Kasich ad Trump's campaign unveiled on Friday, the billionaire businessman and reality television star blasts Kasich as a senior executive at Lehman Brothers, whose 2008 collapse helped spark the financial crisis that led to the Great Recession.On Friday, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's communications director, Alex Conant, said on CNN's This Hour program that Rubio supporters should vote for Kasich in Ohio, to prevent Trump from taking all Ohio's 66 delegates. That statement came with the insinuation that Kasich voters should support Rubio in Florida, in an attempt to gain a brokered political convention in Cleveland.Kasich has rejected the idea of asking his voters to support Rubio in Florida in an attempt to gain a brokered convention, where delegates would be free to vote for other candidates after the first ballot, if Trump would fail to gain the required 1,237 delegates on the first vote.___ (c)2016 the Journal-News (Hamilton, Ohio) Visit the Journal-News (Hamilton, Ohio) at www.journal-news.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

himself onto the political stage, has a U.S. presidential candidate had such a strong impact on juvenile minds.By \"juvenile minds\" I am not referring to the intellectual capacity of those who might vote for The Donald. Well, not necessarily.\u00a0Nope, I mean my grandkids, who range in age from four to 10, proud possessors of juvenile minds but not registered Republicans.During a recent visit to my place they were gaga for America's great imposter.Though many adults no longer find the prospect of a Trump presidency so amusing, my grandkids would crack up at the mere mention of his name.It seemed every cloud looked like Donald Trump's face, every sunset was the colour of his hair (as if that hue could be found in nature). A knot in a plank might resemble his squinty grimace.Last summer, picking up on a careless utterance by their grandfather, they yelled \"I'm an idiot!\" while plunging offthe dock into chilly lake waters. This summer it has been \"Donald\u00a0Trump!\" which amounts to roughly the same thing, I guess.At bedtime, they inserted Donald Trump into their readings of Curious George stories and, perhaps appropriately, books titled The Boy Who Ate the World and Too Many Toys.My grandkidlings have but a hazy idea of who Donald Trump is and what he stands for. I know that because not one of them woke up screaming with night terrors, sobbing \"Donald Trump\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0Donald Trump\" with such anguish that I had to rub their backs and reassure them that he might not be able to get us in Canada. Anyway, my 10-year-old was the instigator of this summer's trumpery at my place.But it soon filtered down the grandchildren chain, as imitation seems to do every summer when these youngsters get together.Each tried to trump the other, so to speak.The climactic moment, our equivalent to Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican Convention, came around the bonfire one night.The kids, in not-so-flattering imitation of their grandfather, were taking turns inventing \"scary\" stories.Most involved some gruesome creature swooping down and devouring children who are wearing, coincidentally, the same clothes that the real children who were listening had just daubed with marshmallows.Our four-year-old, who has mastered the format if not the plot elements of the bonfire ghost story, climbed up on the stump that looks like a decaying alligator corpse and took his turn.\"Once there was an evil man and he snuck up on the bonfire and he came after a girl in brown and a boy in green and a boy in red and a grandpa drinking a beer\" --I may be misquoting him here --\"and captured them and took them away.\"\"And his name was DONALD TWUMP!\" Email hathcharm@gmail.com to contact Tom Mills. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Hillary Clinton, or says that Sec. Clinton and President Obama are the co-founders of ISIS, Rep. Sean Duffy can't ever seem to disagree with Donald Trump - ever.\u00a0\u00a0 While other Republicans are holding their noses as they support Donald Trump, Sean Duffy can't seem to get enough of the Republican nominee's dangerous, bigoted, and divisive language.\u00a0 In a recent interview, Sean Duffy was asked repeatedly if he agrees with Trump's comments that President Obama and Hillary Clinton are the co-founders of ISIS. Over and over again, Duffy couldn't bring himself to break with Donald Trump, until eventually conceding, saying \"no, he isn't on the ground.\" But, of course, Duffy found a way to agree with Trump's dangerous language, following up by saying Donald Trump's comment \"makes the point.\"\u00a0 Sean Duffy didn't stop there, he blamed the media for \"splicing and dicing\" Trump's words, despite his nominee directly saying \"he [President Obama] is the founder of ISIS...he gets the most valuable player award, him and Hillary, she gets it too, I give him co-founder.\" Just like Donald Trump, Rep. Duffy scapegoats the media or anyone else to defend his illogical and false arguments.\u00a0 Earlier in the interview, Sean Duffy was asked about Donald Trump's comments to supporters saying they can stop Hillary Clinton by shooting her, to which Duffy responded \"he says what he means.\" This came moments after Duffy begged Trump to \"stay on script\" and \"read from the teleprompter.\" Like the rest of us, Sean Duffy knows that Donald Trump can't be forced to say things he doesn't believe, making Duffy's support of Trump's dangerous rhetoric and agenda even more troubling.\u00a0 By his own admission, Duffy believes Donald Trump doesn't mince words and there is nothing to parse in his dangerous and sometimes violent rhetoric. That means when Trump insults Gold Star parents he means it; when Trump says we should ban all Muslims from the country he means it; when Trump says his supporters can stop Hillary Clinton by shooting her he means it; and when Trump says Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are the co-founders of ISIS he means it.\u00a0 \"Sean Duffy doesn't care that Donald Trump's dangerous language is deliberate and could have very serious and grave consequences. Sean Duffy will say or do anything to support Donald Trump, even if that means ignoring people's safety,\" Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Martha Laning said on Monday. \"We can have our political differences, but for Sean Duffy to not challenge the violent rhetoric Donald Trump has spouted is shameful and has no place in Wisconsin or the United States.\"  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com   ", "clean_text2": "madison democrat parti issu follow news releas matter donald trump insult gold star parent call ban muslim enter countri suggest second amend support could stop sec hillari clinton say sec clinton presid obama co founder isi rep sean duffi ever seem disagre donald trump ever republican hold nose support donald trump sean duffi seem get enough republican nomine danger bigot divis languag recent interview sean duffi ask repeat agre trump comment presid obama hillari clinton co founder isi duffi bring break donald trump eventu conced say ground cours duffi found way agre trump danger languag follow say donald trump comment make point sean duffi stop blame media splice dice trump word despit nomine direct say presid obama founder isi get valuabl player award hillari get give co founder like donald trump rep duffi scapegoat media anyon els defend illog fals argument earlier interview sean duffi ask donald trump comment support say stop hillari clinton shoot duffi respond say mean came moment duffi beg trump stay script read teleprompt like rest us sean duffi know donald trump forc say thing believ make duffi support trump danger rhetor agenda even troubl admiss duffi believ donald trump minc word noth pars danger sometim violent rhetor mean trump insult gold star parent mean trump say ban muslim countri mean trump say support stop hillari clinton shoot mean trump say hillari clinton barack obama co founder isi mean sean duffi care donald trump danger languag deliber could serious grave consequ sean duffi say anyth support donald trump even mean ignor peopl safeti democrat parti wisconsin chair martha lane said monday polit differ sean duffi challeng violent rhetor donald trump spout shame place wisconsin unit state case queri regard articl content need pleas contact editori plusmediasolut com", "title": "Wisconsin: Donald Trump's Biggest Fan Rep.

When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.\"Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been \"a gift from the comedy gods.\" He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.\"He does two crazy things every day,\" says Kimmel. \"Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.\"Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.\"I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,\" says Kimmel. \"Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.\"When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.\"I don't think he knew who I was,\" says Kimmel. \"I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.\"That was impressive, says Kimmel. \"I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.\"Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he \"immediately fell deeply in love\" with Montreal.\"It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.\"At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). \"We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,\" he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, \"played a lot of tennis back in his day.\"I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,\" says Kimmel. \"It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.\"One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.\"It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.\"Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get \"too inside\" by assuming that the audience has seen your show.\"I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting offon the wrong foot.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

And if either -- or both -- gets more than 5 percent of the vote, it'll be much easier for those parties to get a candidate for governor on the 2018 ballot.\u00a0That's because crossing the 5 percent threshold in Illinois means a party's statewide contenders would only need 5,000 petition signatures to get on the ballot instead of 25,000.Ten years ago, Green Party candidate for governor Rich Whitney got nearly 10 percent of the vote, making it easier for his party to get ballot access, at least temporarily.Gaining exposure:Illinois' Libertarian Party chairman Lex Green said meeting that 5 percent threshold this time is a clear priority.\"Donors and media do not want to talk to us until after we've gotten ballot access,\" he said.Still, it's too early to say how much of a role third-party candidates would play in the 2018 election. In 2014, Chad Grimm, the Libertarian candidate for governor, got a little more than 3 percent of the vote. The Green Party candidate got kicked off the ballot before Election Day.Another lawmaker goneWhile former state Rep. Ron Sandack's abrupt resignation from the Illinois House this week was a surprising move by the Downers Grove Republican, his departure put him on a substantial bipartisan list of suburban lawmakers who won't be in Springfield for the second half of Gov. Bruce Rauner's term -- and there hasn't even been an election yet.In May, Democratic state Rep. Jack Franks of Marengo said he wouldn't run for re-election, seeking the McHenry County Board chairmanship instead. Republican Sen. Dan Duffy of Lake Barrington and Democratic Sen. Dan Kotowski of Park Ridge both left earlier this year for new jobs.Democratic state Sen. Mike Noland of Elgin ran for Congress. And Republican state Reps. Ed Sullivan of Mundelein and Mike Tryon of Crystal Lake both declined to run for re-election.There are departures downstate, too, and incumbent losses in November would add to the list.What's new is old:Questions about whether U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin would run for governor in 2018 bubbled up at the Democratic Party convention this week.\"It's a question about where I can best spend my life. Where can I achieve the goals that I want in public life? If I can do it in Washington and I feel I can be more effective there, of course that's where I'll stay,\" Durbin told the Daily Herald about a potential run for governor -- back in 2000.He would go on to win re-election in 2002.\"I won't make the final decision for some time now,\" he said at the 2000 convention in comments that reflect what he's said this week. \"I want to focus on this election campaign first.\"", "clean_text2": "mani deleg republican democrat convent express dissatisfact parti presidenti nomine discord could effect illinoi 2018 elect voter upset choic donald trump hillari clinton could turn libertarian gari johnson green parti jill stein presid illinoi ballot either get 5 percent vote much easier parti get candid governor 2018 ballot cross 5 percent threshold illinoi mean parti statewid contend would need 5 000 petit signatur get ballot instead 25 000 ten year ago green parti candid governor rich whitney got near 10 percent vote make easier parti get ballot access least temporarili gain exposur illinoi libertarian parti chairman lex green said meet 5 percent threshold time clear prioriti donor media want talk us gotten ballot access said still earli say much role third parti candid would play 2018 elect 2014 chad grimm libertarian candid governor got littl 3 percent vote green parti candid got kick ballot elect day anoth lawmak gonewhil former state rep ron sandack abrupt resign illinoi hous week surpris move downer grove republican departur put substanti bipartisan list suburban lawmak springfield second half gov bruce rauner term even elect yet may democrat state rep jack frank marengo said run elect seek mchenri counti board chairmanship instead republican sen dan duffi lake barrington democrat sen dan kotowski park ridg left earlier year new job democrat state sen mike noland elgin ran congress republican state rep ed sullivan mundelein mike tryon crystal lake declin run elect departur downstat incumb loss novemb would add list new old question whether u sen dick durbin would run governor 2018 bubbl democrat parti convent week question best spend life achiev goal want public life washington feel effect cours stay durbin told daili herald potenti run governor back 2000 would go win elect 2002 make final decis time said 2000 convent comment reflect said week want focus elect campaign first", "title": "How Trump, Clinton backlash may affect state races", "countNoStop": 304, "clean_text": "mani deleg republican democrat convent express dissatisfact parti presidenti nomine discord could effect illinoi 2018 elect voter upset choic donald trump hillari clinton could turn libertarian gari johnson green parti jill stein presid illinoi ballot either get 5 percent vote much easier parti get candid governor 2018 ballot cross 5 percent threshold illinoi mean parti statewid contend would need 5 000 petit signatur get ballot instead 25 000 ten year ago green parti candid governor rich whitney got near 10 percent vote make easier parti get ballot access least temporarili gain exposur illinoi libertarian parti chairman lex green said meet 5 percent threshold time clear prioriti donor media want talk us gotten ballot access said still earli say much role third parti candid would play 2018 elect 2014 chad grimm libertarian candid governor got littl 3 percent vote green parti candid got kick ballot elect day anoth lawmak gonewhil former state rep ron sandack abrupt resign illinoi hous week surpris move downer grove republican departur put substanti bipartisan list suburban lawmak springfield second half gov bruce rauner term even elect yet may democrat state rep jack frank marengo said run elect seek mchenri counti board chairmanship instead republican sen dan duffi lake barrington democrat sen dan kotowski park ridg left earlier year new job democrat state sen mike noland elgin ran congress republican state rep ed sullivan mundelein mike tryon crystal lake declin run elect departur downstat incumb loss novemb would add list new old question whether u sen dick durbin would run governor 2018 bubbl democrat parti convent week question best spend life achiev goal want public life washington feel effect cours stay durbin told daili herald potenti run governor back 2000 would go win elect 2002 make final decis time said 2000 convent comment reflect said week want focus elect campaign first", "byline": "", "countWithStop": 533, "index": "74 of 1000 DOCUMENTS"}, "17": {"date": "April 25, 2016 Monday 11:56 AM GMT", "countNoCusStop": 346, "text": "Donald Trump's presidential rivals have revealed that they are ganging up on the billionaire to stop him becoming the Republican candidate.In two co-ordinated statements, Ted Cruz and John Kasich said they would work tactically together in elections for the good of the party.Mr Cruz, a Texas senator, will focus all of his resources in Indiana while Mr Kasich, the governor of Ohio, will pile into Oregon and New Mexico.

campaign manager's assault chargeCorey Lewandowski: Donald Trump's campaign manager charged with assaultMr Trump now has 845 of the delegates who choose the Republican presidential nominee, Mr Cruz has 559 and Mr Kasich has 148.A candidate must have 1,237 delegates by the time the Republican National Convention is held in July to automatically win the nomination.Should nobody have that number there would be a complicated series of votes in which delegates can back a candidate other than their first-round choice.Mr Cruz and Mr Kasich feel that if this were to happen they could talk delegates around to voting for them instead of Mr Trump.Five states - Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Connecticut - will hold their primaries tomorrow and Mr Trump is expected to win comfortably, but his rivals are looking ahead to Indiana in particular, which is a winner-takes-all state.Last night Mr Cruz's campaign manager Jeff Roe said in a statement: \"To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead.\"Shortly afterwards John Weaver, a strategist for Mr Kasich, put out a statement which said: \"Keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland.\"We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already, and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign's resources west and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.\"Mr Trump's insurgent campaign has rocked the Republican party thanks to his controversial comments on immigration, women and attacks on other countries.It has also spawned a \"Never Trump\" movement among moderate Republicans who are determined to deny him the nomination.Both Mr Trump and Mr Cruz were dealt a blow after one of the Republican party's biggest donors said Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton might make a better US president than either of them.In an interview with ABC News, billionaire Charles Koch described policies put forward by them as \"reminiscent of Nazi Germany\", \"monstrous\" and \"frightening\".Mr Koch was talking about Mr Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US and to create a register, and Mr Cruz's promise to \"carpet bomb\" areas of the Middle East controlled by Islamic State.",

continues to display his inability to keep quiet when criticized and has opened an unwinnable debate with the Muslim American parents of an Army soldier killed in the Middle East.Khizr and Ghazala Khan appeared at the Democratic National Convention, where Mr. Khan called on Republican leaders to reject Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration and called it \"unconstitutional.\"Their son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, 27, was killed by a car bomber in 2004 in Iraq.\u00a0Trump is now rightfully drawing criticism from multiple sources and both sides of the political aisle for his disparaging comments about this Gold Star family.Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, Monday in a written statement strongly condemned Trump's statement about the Khan family.\"In recent days, Donald Trump disparaged a fallen soldier's parents,\" said McCain. \"He suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States--to say nothing of entering its service. I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump's statement.\"McCain, a respected politician on national security within the Republican Party and a former prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, is not the only one to criticize Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric.On Monday, the Veterans of Foreign Wars condemned Trump and a group of Gold Star families of fallen service members called on Trump to apologize for his Khan comments.\"Election year or not, the VFW will not tolerate anyone berating a Gold Star family member for exercising his or her right of speech or expression,\" said Brian Duffy, VFW president. \"Giving one's life to a nation is the greatest sacrifice, followed closely by all Gold Star families, who have a right to make their voices heard.\"In a letter published Monday on VoteVets.org, a group of 11 \"Gold Star\" families wrote, \"Your recent comments regarding the khan family were repugnant and personally offensive to us. We ... demand you apologize to the Khans, to all Gold Star families, and to all Americans for your offensive, and frankly anti-American comments.\"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said in a statement: \"There used to be some things that were sacred in American politics--that you don't do--like criticizing the parents of a fallen soldier even if they criticize you.\"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweeted, \"This is so incredibly disrespectful of a family that endured the ultimate sacrifice for our country.\"The White House rebuked Trump's statements, saying that Gold Star families deserve \"honor and gratitude\" for their family member's sacrifice. On Monday, President Obama told a veterans group that Gold Star families \"have made a sacrifice that most of us can't even begin to imagine.\"The swift condemnation of Trump's comments about the Khans by multiple individuals and groups means this controversy may not go away anytime soon.With fewer than 100 days remaining to Election Day, this controversy will increase pressure upon Republican leaders and candidates to determine whether they will continue to support the GOP nominee.McCain, a former Republican nominee for president, wrote Monday in a statement \"... To Mr. and Mrs. Khan: thank you for immigrating to America. We're a better country because of you. And you are certainly right; your son was the best of America, and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation--and he will not be forgotten.\"Kudos to McCain and others for standing up for respect and loyalty to our service men and women and against hatred and bigotry in America.Trump could and should learn a lesson from the example of McCain and others. The sooner he learns this lesson, the better off America will be.___ (c)2016 West Central Tribune (Willmar, Minn.)

interview on CNN* * *\u00a0THE RULING: FALSEWhat do Donald Trump and Justin Bieber have in common?Humongous hair?Big bucks?How about a case of abortion contortion?Sarah Palin compared their abortion stances during the Feb. 1 edition of CNN's The Lead. Jake Tapper asked the former Alaska governor and Trump supporter about Trump's turnabout on the issue of abortion.\"Donald Trump is somebody who has clearly had different positions on issues that he has today,\" said Tapper. \"He called himself very pro-choice. Now he says he's very pro-life.\"\"I am so glad Mr. Trump has seen the light,\" Palin responded, saying it was sad that anti-abortion groups were giving the candidate a hard time about his switch when other people who have had a change of heart on the issue have been celebrated.She cited, as an example, singer Justin Bieber.Tapper didn't quite understand and, in essence, asked her, what do you mean?Bieber \"has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him,\" Palin said. \"He's just one example.\"We wondered whether the pop star really had the same type of conversion as Trump or whether Palin had gone overboard.Trump's change of position on the abortion question is well-established. When Trump was first considering a third-party presidential run in 1999, he said on NBC's Meet the Press that although he hated the concept of abortion, \"I am pro-choice in every respect.\" By mid February 2011, when there was talk again that he would run for president, he declared, \"I am pro-life.\"Whether the Biebs transitioned from abortion support to abortion opposition is not as clear.We contacted Palin through her political action committee and sought comment from Bieber through the office of his manager, Scooter Braun. We didn't hear back from either.So we decided to try to find out for ourselves. No pressure.The only reference to the abortion issue we could find was Bieber's interview with Rolling Stone, published in February 2011. He was 16 at the time.\"I really don't believe in abortion. I think (an embryo) is a human,\" Bieber told the magazine. \"It's like killing a baby.\"When he was asked about abortion in cases of rape, his response was, \"Um. Well, I think that's really sad, but everything happens for a reason. I don't know how that would be a reason. I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that.\"The rape comment in particular caused some controversy at the time, and since then Bieber has shied away from the issue.He got drawn back into it peripherally when his mother, Pattie Mallette, a born-again Christian, promoted a short anti-abortion film in 2013. Mallette had previously written of the pressure she experienced to have an abortion when she was 17 and carrying the now-pop superstar.The Chicago Sun-Times said in a Jan. 21, 2013, story that it had spoken with an unnamed \"longtime Bieber associate\" who claimed, \"I don't believe he agrees with his mom on this issue.\"Some might interpret that to mean that Bieber is now pro-abortion - which would signal a new position on abortion that, sorry, does not fit Palin's point. However, PolitiFact has a policy of not relying on unnamed or secondhand sources to speak for what others believe.Our rulingPalin said Bieber \"has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him.\"At PolitiFact, we believe it's the responsibility of the person making a claim to provide the evidence to back it up. Palin didn't respond to our query.The only reasonable conclusion at this point is that Bieber hasn't changed his position on abortion like Trump.Nonetheless, we never say never: If on-the-record evidence of Bieber supporting abortion prior to his Rolling Stone interview turns up, we'll consider a different ruling.Until then, Palin's claim is not substantiated. We rate her claim False.* * *About this statement:Published: Friday, February 5th, 2016 at 2:35 p.m.Researched by: C.

Clashes appeared to be mostly verbal, but some people were videorecorded throwing punches and shoving.\"Are you guys satisfied?\" one red-faced Trump supporter repeatedly yelled, jabbing his finger at TV news crews on risers.Emily Jahn, of Grayslake, said she and her mother attended the event not to show support or opposition but just to see what happened.\"He wouldn't have put it at a college campus in the middle of Chicago unless he wanted people to get mad,\" she said. \"I think it's what he wanted, to get attention.\"What happens now for Trump and his primary race against Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich could play out over the coming days. Illinois' primary is Tuesday.In an interview with MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews, Trump was defensive and argued that anger boiling over at his rallies had been building for years and was not spurred by his campaign alone.\"We have a very divided country,\" Trump said. \"We have a country that's so divided that maybe even you don't understand it. I've never seen anything like it.\"Cruz, speaking Friday at the Northwest Suburban Republicans' Lincoln Day Dinner in Rolling Meadows, called the clash at UIC \"a sad day\" but suggested Trump's rhetoric was partly responsible. \"I hope going forward for a respectful, substantive, issue-based discussion,\" Cruz said.Trump and all of the Republican candidates initially had been invited to the Rolling Meadows dinner, and after his Chicago rally was shut down Trump offered to make an appearance but was \"politely declined,\" a source said.Trump has run a campaign aimed at disrupting the political establishment, and many of the protesters Friday night were backers of the race's other anti-establishment candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.Hundreds of protesters inside the UIC Pavilion chanted \"Bernie, Bernie,\" who also had a rally Friday night in the suburbs.Trump's campaign issued a statement saying Trump had arrived in Chicago and \"after meeting with law enforcement has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight's rally will be postponed to another date. Thank you very much for your attendance and please go in peace.\"The Chicago Police Department said it was informed shortly before 6:30 p.m. that the Trump campaign had canceled the event. Police were not consulted before the decision was made, according to spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.Kevin Booker, chief of the University of Illinois at Chicago police, said no one was injured or arrested as the arena was emptied.After the rally, protesters took to the streets where they were lined up behind barricades and faced by many police officers, including more than a dozen officers on horses.\"Who won? We won,\" hundreds of protesters chanted.Barry Rush, a medical student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says he disagrees with Trump's rhetoric and hopes other cities will follow Chicago.\"I think that other cities will follow and will show him that we're not going to stand for this kind of junk,\" Rush said.Thirty-two people were arrested at a St. Louis rally earlier Friday, and reports of violence at recent Trump events dogged the candidate in Thursday night's debate.\"People come with tremendous passion and love for the country,\" Trump said at Thursday's debate. \"When they see what's going on in this country, they have anger that's unbelievable.\"A white Trump supporter was charged with assault Thursday after video showed him hitting a black man being escorted out of the venue by sheriff's deputies at a campaign rally Wednesday in North Carolina.Trump told MSNBC in a telephone interview after the Chicago cancellation: \"I just don't want to see people hurt. We can come back and do it another time.\"But with the election four days away, it was unclear what he meant.Sanders, who addressed a rally of his own Friday in Summit, expressed concern over the incident.\"I hope that we are not in a moment in American history where people are going to be intimidated and roughed up and frightened about going to a political rally ... . I hope Mr. Trump speaks out forcefully and tells his supporters that that is not what the American political process is about.\"* The Washington Post contributed to this article.", "clean_text2":

But it may not be too late for you, other members of the media! Please read and implement.  The Pillars of Covering Trump: \u00a01. Donald Trump is never wrong.Donald Trump is infallible - like the pope but with more raw sexual charisma. If Donald Trump appears to be wrong in a story, either because of a statement or an action, or some combination of the two, it should be rewritten so that he is not wrong. A good baseline for what is fair and honest coverage is that fair and honest coverage depicts Donald Trump as the shining, golden god he is, envied of men and beloved of women. Unfair, dishonest coverage does not depict Donald Trump this way.2. Style is as important as substance. A good article about Donald Trump includes at least one of the following words: \"huge,\" \"great,\" \"manly,\" \"terrific,\" \"incredible,\" \"fantastic,\" \"remarkable,\" \"big\"/\"bigly,\" \"immense,\" \"girthy,\" \"magisterial,\" \"gargantuan,\" \"tumescent.\" Ideally, this word would be in the headline. A bad article about Donald Trump includes the words or phrases \"puny,\" \"dangerous,\" \"Godwin's law,\" \"cocktail shrimp in a toupee,\" \"husk of dead skin and hyperbole,\" \"garbage fart,\" \"what results if you accidentally leave Guy Fieri in a microwave.\"3. Does Donald Trump contradict himself? Very well; he contradicts himself. Donald Trump is large. Donald Trump contains multitudes.4. Who among us has not been in the position where what he means to say is something wise and temperate and what actually comes out of his mouth is a garbage fart? Equipped with this knowledge, it is often best to take into account what Donald Trump should have said and to report that instead of what he actually did say. (The great historian Thucydides used to do this, which is why Pericles's Funeral Oration is so lovely.)5. Remember the transitive property of Trump: Whenever Donald Trump loves something, it loves him back. Donald Trump loves women. Therefore, women love Donald Trump. Donald Trump loves Hispanics. Therefore, Hispanics love Donald Trump. Any polls that obscure these truths should be disregarded.6. Donald Trump's hair is real. Well, no. \"Real\" is putting it too mildly. Donald Trump's hair is a fact that transcends reality or unreality, not to be questioned, merely to be admired, like the triune nature of God or the singular beauty and excellence of a Donald Trump building.7. Two words: LARGE HANDS.8. Facts are often biased against Donald Trump and should be used sparingly in reporting, if at all. Think of them as a garnish, not an entree.9. Donald Trump's word suffices. Fact-checking is at best gauche and at worst treasonous. What is fact? Donald Trump speaks truth, which is bigger than fact. Donald Trump loves you. You love Donald Trump.10. Donald Trump believes that criticism is healthy. As Noel Coward put it, Donald Trump can take any amount of criticism, so long as it is unqualified praise. Some Frequently Asked Questions on Fair Trump Coverage: Q: Can I just print a transcript of what Donald Trump said? A: No. This is very mean and bad. What Donald Trump actually says is, of course, uniformly good and correct. But sometimes if you just write it out and give it to people to see, they will not think so. Therefore, this is to be avoided.Q: What is a fair question?  A: An example of a fair question is: \"Donald Trump, why are you so good at business?\" An example of an unfair or \"gotcha\" question is: \"Why did Lincoln succeed?\"Q: Can I describe what someone did at a Trump rally?  A: Yes, if that someone is Donald Trump and what that someone did was \"be awesome without interruption.\"Q: What if Donald Trump didn't answer my question?  A: Not true. Donald Trump has given you the answer. Your question was not correct. This isn't hard, just think of it like \"Jeopardy!\"Q: In the statement issued by the Trump campaign stating that it will stop credentialing Post reporters, the campaign said, \"Mr. Trump does not mind a bad story, but it has to be honest.\" What is a bad story that is honest that Mr. Trump would not mind?  A: A story about Hillary Clinton.Alexandra Petri writes the ComPost blog at washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost.", "clean_text2": "style guid cover donald trump honest fair late work post credenti revok

provisions of the Libel Act of 2017,\" the New Yorker suggests helpfully, \"President Trump's name can be used in the following sentences\":\"Donald Trump has good ideas!\"\"I agree with President Donald Trump.\"\"Donald Trump knows money. He's great with money, the best. His house is gold. I'm off to write Donald Trump a nice letter.\" \u00a0\"Another excellent speech by President Donald\u00a0Trump!\" \"I disagree with Donald Trump. Just kidding. Sorry, bad joke.\" \"The flag looks better with President Trump's changes.\"Donald\u00a0Trump doesn't like the press, particularly their questions about him, and made it clear last week that President Trump would do something about us, the First Amendment notwithstanding. He's in good company - Turkey, Myanmar, Thailand, not to mention most of South America, China and North Korea, all share the view that disparaging remarks about the leader merit sanctions, often severe.If elected, Trump says, he would \"open up\" libel laws to make it easier to sue the media. The change was necessary to fight what he described as the \"dishonesty\" of major American newspapers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. \"I'm going to open up our libel law so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money . . . We're going to have people sue like you've never been sued before.\" And \"The press is amazingly dishonest. The press is a real problem in this country.\"For journalists covering his campaign, life is already distinctly uncomfortable. He fences off the press at his rallies and invites the audience to boo them, which they do enthusiastically. He recently joked about killing journalists and the crowd applauded. Autocratic identification  In a week that he tweeted Mussolini and sidled away from repudiating a Ku Klux Klan endorsement, Trump has also identified himself with some of the world's most autocratic regimes.  A report this week paints a bleak picture on press freedom in South and Central America. A study from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and the Thomson Reuters Foundation finds that, despite the fact that criminal defamation laws violate international freedom of expression standards, only Jamaica has entirely repealed laws that would permit journalists to be prosecuted for their reporting. Two-thirds of the countries in North, Central and South America routinely use such laws to silence dissent and keep information from their citizens, the report said.Offences include defamation, libel, calumny, or making false charges, and \"desacato\" offences which refer to insulting or offending the state or a state official.But perhaps nowhere does the civil use of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 -type laws, still used widely to \"protect\" the king in Thailand, get more use than in Turkey where, since August 2014 when Recep Tayyip Erdogan assumed the presidency, 1,845 criminal cases have been opened against Turks for insulting the president, a crime that carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. Protest as crime  Teachers, artists, journalists, a well-known soccer star and even schoolchildren have been caught in the net - many jailed. The most common protest chant that has been subject to prosecution is: \"Thief! Murderer! Erdogan!\" Setting the bar low, justice minister Bekir Bozdag insists \"nobody should have the freedom to swear\".  The result has mostly been suspended sentences but many have faced pretrial detention. Dozens of journalists have lost their jobs because of coverage considered critical of the government, which closed 96,000 websites last year.Perhaps the strangest defamation case currently under way, however, is in Myanmar and also relates to political muzzling. It involves 24-year-old poet Maung Saungkha, who was charged recently after publishing a poem on his Facebook page that suggested he had a portrait of President Thein Sein on his penis.Whether he has in fact illustrated his penis is not clear, and Saungkha may have to expose himself in the course of the trial to establish the truth. But he is one of several who have fallen foul of a law that prohibits online defamation of the army or the president on Facebook. (In Thailand you can get into trouble for \"liking\" a post that is defamatory of the king.)Saungkha, an interfaith democracy activist, and a member of a youth group connected to Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD party, wonders what the country's new much-vaunted press freedom means if he can be charged with such an offence.And quite how a poem about a picture of a president on a penis constitutes defamation is bewildering. Trump would understand. What was that we said about his hair?

Montreal this past week for the Just for Laughs comedy festival and to be a judge on Jeff Ross Presents Roast Battle (available for streaming at thecomedynetwork. ca).Like a few other comedians, he drew the line at comparing the Republican presidential candidate to the late Toronto mayor.\u00a0\"Canadians like to say that,\" says Kimmel, \"but let's not forget that Rob Ford was smoking crack. When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.\"Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been \"a gift from the comedy gods.\" He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.\"He does two crazy things every day,\" says Kimmel. \"Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.\"Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.\"I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,\" says Kimmel. \"Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.\"When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.\"I don't think he knew who I was,\" says Kimmel. \"I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.\"That was impressive, says Kimmel. \"I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.\"Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he \"immediately fell deeply in love\" with Montreal.\"It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.\"At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). \"We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,\" he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, \"played a lot of tennis back in his day.\"I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,\" says Kimmel. \"It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.\"One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.\"It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.\"Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV.

It takes its title from the controversial businessman turned politician's 1987 best-seller. The spoof is pitched as a TV movie, made by Trump, to illuminate his road to success and provide tips for others to follow.\"It was a crazy, completely nuts idea that somehow we pulled off,\" Adam McKay, another of the site's co-founders, told the New York Times. McKay has been nominated in the best director at the forthcoming Oscar's for his financial comedy The Big Short.Depp reportedly spent four days in December making the film after being approached by McKay earlier in the year. Funny or Die's editor in chief, Owen Burke, described Depp's performance \"absolutely bananas\" and explained that keeping the film secret was surprisingly easy. \"We had a few people sign non-disclosures, but mostly we just begged people not to say anything,\" Burke said. \"The plan was to move really fast because we thought Trump would go away, as least as a presidential candidate. When he bizarrely didn't go away, we had a little more time. But that meant keeping the secret for longer.\"", "clean_text2": "comedi websit funni die releas surpris 50 minut film controversi businessman turn politician donald trump wake victori new hampshir primari relat michael moor donald trump perform artist donald trump art deal movi made site co found ferrel star johnni depp central role support provid ron howard alfr molina christoph lloyd take titl controversi businessman turn politician 1987 best seller spoof pitch tv movi made trump illumin road success provid tip other follow crazi complet nut idea somehow pull adam mckay anoth site co founder told new york time mckay nomin best director forthcom oscar financi comedi big short depp report spent four day decemb make film approach mckay earlier year funni die editor chief owen burk describ depp perform absolut banana explain keep film secret surpris easi peopl sign non disclosur most beg peopl say anyth burk said plan move realli fast thought trump would go away least presidenti candid bizarr go away littl time meant keep secret longer", "title": "Funny or Die releases spoof Donald Trump biopic starring Johnny Depp; Comedy website launches Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie, a 50-minute mock TV film about the controversial figure", "countNoStop": 159, "clean_text": "comedi websit funni die releas surpris 50 minut film controversi businessman turn politician donald trump wake victori new hampshir primari relat michael moor donald trump perform artist donald trump art deal movi made site co found ferrel star johnni depp central role support provid ron howard alfr molina christoph lloyd take titl controversi businessman turn politician 1987 best seller spoof pitch tv movi made trump illumin road success provid tip other follow crazi complet nut idea somehow pull adam mckay anoth site co founder told new york time mckay nomin best director forthcom oscar financi comedi big short depp report spent four day decemb make film approach mckay earlier year funni die editor chief owen burk describ depp perform absolut banana explain keep film secret surpris easi peopl sign non disclosur most beg peopl say anyth burk said plan move realli fast thought trump would go away least presidenti candid bizarr go away littl time meant keep secret longer", "byline": "Benjamin Lee", "countWithStop": 269, "index": "54 of 1000 DOCUMENTS"}, "35": {"date": "August 20, 2016 Saturday", "countNoCusStop": 252, "text": " Madison: Democratic Party has issued the following news release:   During a Friday interview with conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said \"of course\" there is something Donald Trump could do to make him pull his endorsement of the Republican nominee. When asked exactly what that something is Ryan said, \"where that line gets crossed - I don't know where that is.\"\u00a0 Wisconsinites are also wondering where that line is for Speaker Ryan. Mr. Trump has mocked a disabled reporter, said John McCain is not a war hero because he was captured, wants to ban people from immigrating to America based on their religion, claimed a federal judge's ethnicity prevents him from doing his job, wanted congratulations for anticipating the worst mass shooting in U.S. history and even advocated for the murder the wives and children of terrorists. Just this week he disrespected the grieving parents of an American war hero and was caught making false claims on countless occasions. Each and every time Speaker Ryan has responded with empty explanations and more often, silence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Donald Trump has crossed every line there is - except, apparently, Paul Ryan's line.\u00a0 Other Wisconsin Republicans have been similarly desperate to thread the needle with Mr. Trump, condemning his behavior but never doing anything about it. That may be because many of Donald Trump's ideas are exactly in line with the policies Republicans have established in Wisconsin.\u00a0 Since taking office in 2010, Governor Walker and the Republican-controlled legislature have been diligently working to take the same kind of hateful, misogynistic and regressive ideas we hear in Donald Trump's speeches and turn them into law.\u00a0 From assaulting women's reproductive rights to attempting to denying minority, elderly and low-income Wisconsinites the right to vote, Wisconsin Republicans have demonstrated that they are more ideologically aligned with Donald Trump's offensive ideas than they are willing to publicly admit. The only difference is that Wisconsin Republicans prefer to accomplish their dangerous policy goals in backrooms with the support of billionaire special interests, while Donald Trump shouts out his outrageous policies on the national stage.    \"Paul Ryan and Wisconsin Republican leaders either share Donald Trump's principles, or lack the political courage to stand up to his hateful and divisive rhetoric. No matter which it is, they are letting down the people of this state and throwing their support behind a man who is temperamentally unfit to be President.\" said Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Martha Laning.

Donald Trump wants to ban an entire religion from entering our country and Donald Trump loves to talk to the press,\" she said.Trump is to be anointed as Republican presidential nominee at the four-day convention in Cleveland by the party once led by Abraham Lincoln, the president who abolished slavery in the 19th century.Clinton told the conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which Trump declined to address, that the Republicans were becoming the party of Trump.\"It is a threat to our democracy and it all adds up to an undeniable conclusion Donald Trump cannot become president,\" she said to huge applause and delegates leaping to their feet.\"That's why we've got to work together to get the vote out this fall,\" she said, announcing a nationwide drive to get three million people registered to vote in the November 8 general election.It is customary for presidential candidates to address the NAACP convention but the presumptive Republican nominee snubbed an invitation to speak at the Cincinnati event.The Trump campaign gave no reason, as the candidate's wife Melania prepared to take the stage at the Republican convention later Monday, just 250 miles (400 kilometers) away in the same state.Ohio is a key battleground state and Trump lost the Republican primary to Governor John Kasich. But a recent NBC News poll put Clinton and Trump tied at 39 percent with 21 percent of voters undecided.The former US secretary of state used much of her speech to call for criminal justice reform, an end to systemic racism and to denounce the killing of police officers as totally unjustified.\"This madness has to stop,\" she said in reference to the attack Sunday that killed three police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana\"We have difficult, painful, essential work ahead of us to repair the bonds between our police and our communities, and between and among each other,\" she added.\"The next president should make the commitment to fight for the reforms we so desperately need, holding police departments like Ferguson accountable,\" she said to deafening applause.The 2014 shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, unleashed widespread protests, some violent, about fatal police shootings. The decision not to indict the police officer prompted more protests across the country.Founded in 1909, the NAACP is America's oldest and largest civil rights organization, campaigning to end racial discrimination.Her voice cracking with emotion, Clinton also read from the Facebook post of Montrell Jackson, one of the officers killed in Louisiana on Sunday, who spoke of his hurt at being met with hostility when on duty, and viewed as a threat  as a black man  when out of uniform\"We have to heal the divides that remain, make the United States what it should be  stronger and fairer, more opportunity for everyone of our people,\" she said.The NAACP gave her a warm welcome on Monday. Members of the audience expressed disappointment that Trump chose to stay away and said Clinton appeared to be the candidate best suited to ending inequality.", "clean_text2": "hillari clinton sought
