</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This style guide to covering Donald Trump honestly and fairly is too late for me, because I work at The Post, which has had its credentials revoked by the Trump campaign.   But it may not be too late for you, other members of the media! Please read and implement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pillars of Covering Trump: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Donald Trump is never wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump is infallible - like the pope but with more raw sexual charisma. If Donald Trump appears to be wrong in a story, either because of a statement or an action, or some combination of the two, it should be rewritten so that he is not wrong. A good baseline for what is fair and honest coverage is that fair and honest coverage depicts Donald Trump as the shining, golden god he is, envied of men and beloved of women. Unfair, dishonest coverage does not depict Donald Trump this way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Style is as important as substance. A good article about Donald Trump includes at least one of the following words: &quot;huge,&quot; &quot;great,&quot; &quot;manly,&quot; &quot;terrific,&quot; &quot;incredible,&quot; &quot;fantastic,&quot; &quot;remarkable,&quot; &quot;big&quot;/&quot;bigly,&quot; &quot;immense,&quot; &quot;girthy,&quot; &quot;magisterial,&quot; &quot;gargantuan,&quot; &quot;tumescent.&quot; Ideally, this word would be in the headline. A bad article about Donald Trump includes the words or phrases &quot;puny,&quot; &quot;dangerous,&quot; &quot;Godwin's law,&quot; &quot;cocktail shrimp in a toupee,&quot; &quot;husk of dead skin and hyperbole,&quot; &quot;garbage fart,&quot; &quot;what results if you accidentally leave Guy Fieri in a microwave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Does Donald Trump contradict himself? Very well; he contradicts himself. Donald Trump is large. Donald Trump contains multitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Who among us has not been in the position where what he means to say is something wise and temperate and what actually comes out of his mouth is a garbage fart? Equipped with this knowledge, it is often best to take into account what Donald Trump should have said and to report that instead of what he actually did say. (The great historian Thucydides used to do this, which is why Pericles's Funeral Oration is so lovely.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Remember the transitive property of Trump: Whenever Donald Trump loves something, it loves him back. Donald Trump loves women. Therefore, women love Donald Trump. Donald Trump loves Hispanics. Therefore, Hispanics love Donald Trump. Any polls that obscure these truths should be disregarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Donald Trump's hair is real. Well, no. &quot;Real&quot; is putting it too mildly. Donald Trump's hair is a fact that transcends reality or unreality, not to be questioned, merely to be admired, like the triune nature of God or the singular beauty and excellence of a Donald Trump building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Two words: LARGE HANDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Facts are often biased against Donald Trump and should be used sparingly in reporting, if at all. Think of them as a garnish, not an entree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Donald Trump's word suffices. Fact-checking is at best gauche and at worst treasonous. What is fact? Donald Trump speaks truth, which is bigger than fact. Donald Trump loves you. You love Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Donald Trump believes that criticism is healthy. As Noel Coward put it, Donald Trump can take any amount of criticism, so long as it is unqualified praise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some Frequently Asked Questions on Fair Trump Coverage: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Can I just print a transcript of what Donald Trump said? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: No. This is very mean and bad. What Donald Trump actually says is, of course, uniformly good and correct. But sometimes if you just write it out and give it to people to see, they will not think so. Therefore, this is to be avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What is a fair question?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: An example of a fair question is: &quot;Donald Trump, why are you so good at business?&quot; An example of an unfair or &quot;gotcha&quot; question is: &quot;Why did Lincoln succeed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Can I describe what someone did at a Trump rally?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Yes, if that someone is Donald Trump and what that someone did was &quot;be awesome without interruption.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What if Donald Trump didn't answer my question?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Not true. Donald Trump has given you the answer. Your question was not correct. This isn't hard, just think of it like &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: In the statement issued by the Trump campaign stating that it will stop credentialing Post reporters, the campaign said, &quot;Mr. Trump does not mind a bad story, but it has to be honest.&quot; What is a bad story that is honest that Mr. Trump would not mind?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: A story about Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Under the provisions of the Libel Act of 2017,&quot; the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New Yorker</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggests helpfully, &quot;President Trump's name can be used in the following sentences&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump has good ideas!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I agree with President Donald Trump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump knows money. He's great with money, the best. His house is gold. I'm off to write Donald Trump a nice letter.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another excellent speech by President Donald&nbsp;Trump!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I disagree with Donald Trump. Just kidding. Sorry, bad joke.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The flag looks better with President Trump's changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald&nbsp;Trump doesn't like the press, particularly their questions about him, and made it clear last week that President Trump would do something about us, the First Amendment notwithstanding. He's in good company - Turkey, Myanmar, Thailand, not to mention most of South America, China and North Korea, all share the view that disparaging remarks about the leader merit sanctions, often severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If elected, Trump says, he would &quot;open up&quot; libel laws to make it easier to sue the media. The change was necessary to fight what he described as the &quot;dishonesty&quot; of major American newspapers such as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Washington Post</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;I'm going to open up our libel law so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money . . . We're going to have people sue like you've never been sued before.&quot; And &quot;The press is amazingly dishonest. The press is a real problem in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For journalists covering his campaign, life is already distinctly uncomfortable. He fences off the press at his rallies and invites the audience to boo them, which they do enthusiastically. He recently joked about killing journalists and the crowd applauded. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Autocratic identification </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a week that he tweeted Mussolini and sidled away from repudiating a Ku Klux Klan endorsement, Trump has also identified himself with some of the world's most autocratic regimes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report this week paints a bleak picture on press freedom in South and Central America. A study from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and the Thomson Reuters Foundation finds that, despite the fact that criminal defamation laws violate international freedom of expression standards, only Jamaica has entirely repealed laws that would permit journalists to be prosecuted for their reporting. Two-thirds of the countries in North, Central and South America routinely use such laws to silence dissent and keep information from their citizens, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offences include defamation, libel, calumny, or making false charges, and &quot;desacato&quot; offences which refer to insulting or offending the state or a state official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps nowhere does the civil use of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -type laws, still used widely to &quot;protect&quot; the king in Thailand, get more use than in Turkey where, since August 2014 when Recep Tayyip Erdogan assumed the presidency, 1,845 criminal cases have been opened against Turks for insulting the president, a crime that carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Protest as crime </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Teachers, artists, journalists, a well-known soccer star and even schoolchildren have been caught in the net - many jailed. The most common protest chant that has been subject to prosecution is: &quot;Thief! Murderer! Erdogan!&quot; Setting the bar low, justice minister Bekir Bozdag insists &quot;nobody should have the freedom to swear&quot;.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result has mostly been suspended sentences but many have faced pretrial detention. Dozens of journalists have lost their jobs because of coverage considered critical of the government, which closed 96,000 websites last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the strangest defamation case currently under way, however, is in Myanmar and also relates to political muzzling. It involves 24-year-old poet Maung Saungkha, who was charged recently after publishing a poem on his Facebook page that suggested he had a portrait of President Thein Sein on his penis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether he has in fact illustrated his penis is not clear, and Saungkha may have to expose himself in the course of the trial to establish the truth. But he is one of several who have fallen foul of a law that prohibits online defamation of the army or the president on Facebook. (In Thailand you can get into trouble for &quot;liking&quot; a post that is defamatory of the king.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saungkha, an interfaith democracy activist, and a member of a youth group connected to Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD party, wonders what the country's new much-vaunted press freedom means if he can be charged with such an offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And quite how a poem about a picture of a president on a penis constitutes defamation is bewildering. Trump would understand. What was that we said about his hair? Sorry, President Trump.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLEVELAND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have always been at war with Eurasia. Snowball the Pig is responsible for everything that is wrong on the farm. How fortunate we are to have Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump is the miracle product that will fix everything that is wrong in your home. He is also your father figure (put your little hand in his). He'll be your dream, your wish, your fantasy, your hope, your love, everything that you need. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is the way, the truth and the life. None shall be saved except through him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will protect you. He will fix your aching bones and your bad hearing and when you walk home at night you will know that nothing can harm you, because Trump is there. You will get a good-paying job. The thing in the shadows that frightens you will melt away as if it were never real to begin with. (And perhaps it wasn't.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will also build a wall. It will be as tall as you want it to be. If you want the moon (Newt Gingrich does!), he will throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you. He will solve all your problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why should you believe that he will do this? Listen, you're awful nosy, aren't you? Isn't the word of Donald Trump's children enough for you? (I would say, &quot;And the words of his wife, Melania,&quot; but those turned out not to be her words.) They spent the past week praising him to the skies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Say what you will about dictators, royalty, mafia dons, supervillains and Trumps, they have a well-defined aesthetic. You get an immense, Wizard-of-Oz-scale picture of your head, some flags, and then you stand in front of it with your well-groomed family, and they say that if only people knew the real you, they would admit that you were great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, Thursday night kicked off with a long, rambling speech from someone who had once seen Donald Trump write a nice note to a young boy in the middle of a Mike Tyson fight. (This was the nicest story that anyone who was not literally related to Donald Trump could come up with.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His daughter Ivanka introduced her father, saying that he had been extremely kind to and supportive of her. (If there is one thing we learned this week, it is that Donald Trump is very nice to his children. But hear me out: What if Donald Trump maybe treats his children differently than he does most people? Could that be it?) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then Donald Trump began to do what he has meant to do this whole time: talk about Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Barack Obama was supposed to be your new bicycle, then Donald Trump is your new miracle juicer. He looks better on TV than he actually is. He is mostly plastic and he probably won't work when you get him home. But the commercial makes him sound like the solution to everything that ails you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this case, he went on for 76 (such a patriotic number!) minutes, advertising himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love you,&quot; Donald Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am your voice,&quot; Donald Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Believe me,&quot; Donald Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody knows the system better than me,&quot; Donald Trump said, &quot;which is why I alone can fix it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How? There is no how. All that has to happen for a thing to be so is for Donald Trump to say it. This is certainly how all his statistics work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clear your mind of questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will bring back law and order and end lawlessness, but also he will decrease regulations. We need more law and order, but also we need fewer laws and more freedom. Whatever is wrong, Donald Trump will fix it, even if it contradicts the thing he just fixed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truths of religion are not the same as the truths of daily life. Faith has to get you through the day with the promise that things will improve. It does not have to withstand strict logical scrutiny. It can be an article of faith that something is two contradictory things at once. There is a hidden logic to its incoherence. It coheres because it offers a single system for fixing everything that ails you. It answers all your woes. It fits all complaints. Just like Donald Trump. Everything he touches with his hands - which are the correct size - he cures, or at least turns to gold-colored brass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump is selling America a miracle juicer. The juicer is Donald Trump. It is orange and it will never let you down. If you order now, Donald Trump will send you another one free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump will make America great again. &quot;Great&quot; is a vague word. It means whatever you want it to mean. Donald Trump will make America that place you see when you close your eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the crowd cheered, &quot;Yes, you will!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You love Donald Trump. He will be a dear, dear leader.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's almost conventional wisdom: We in the &quot;Rust Belt&quot; will swarm to Trump because the average middle-class worker believes Trump can magically reverse the ravages of the modern global economy. Or, short of that, blow up the status quo trying. And by mobilizing this base of older, white, working-class men in his anti-establishment crusade, Trump can compete in traditional Democratic-leaning states and redraw the Electoral College map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It isn't only Fox News and right-wing talk radio espousing this, but publications such as The Economist, The New York Times, The New Yorker and The Atlantic, among others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rustproofing,&quot; reads the headline in the latest edition of The Economist, asking in the subhead: &quot;Can Donald Trump flip the old manufacturing regions of the Midwest?&quot; A recent op-ed in the Times was headlined, &quot;Donald Trump's Appeal to Rust Belt workers.&quot; The New Yorker's headline: &quot;Donald Trump and the idea of the Rust Belt.&quot; And The Atlantic: &quot;Donald Trump's Path to the Presidency Runs through the Rust Belt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there appears to be consensus among East Coast media that we in manufacturing regions around the Great Lakes are so damn angry about our stagnating prospects that we are susceptible to a demagogue like Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suspect this broad-brush analysis results in part from the spectacle of Trump's primary campaign, which memorably featured images of not only the angriest, but also the most racist and anti-immigrant citizens among us. The size of that group may be finite, but we sure have seen a lot of them lately. They made for good television, while displays of centrism and pragmatism are relegated to C-SPAN, public television and wonky podcasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This stereotyping of flyover country as a region filled with decay and anger seems widely held. Consider the very term &quot;Rust Belt,&quot; a 1980s descriptor that suggests that the whole of the Great Lakes region resembles only its most distressed inner cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wisconsin, of course, is trying to evolve and reinvigorate its economy by moving from reliance on manufacturing jobs toward jobs with a technology component. It doesn't help to have the state linked to rust ? a word whose synonyms include dilapidated, decaying, crumbling and corroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A digression: Last month, Dave Cieslewicz began his column in Isthmus with this: &quot;We are not the #%&amp;*@ Rust Belt, for cryin' out loud.&quot; The former two-term mayor emailed me to enlist my support in his campaign to, well, combat rust. He called the description damaging, inaccurate and insulting. (I'm a bit tardy here, Dave, but I agree.) But I think there is something more sinister and, I hope, misguided in this narrative of regional white male backlash in favor of Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's &quot;make America great again&quot; mantra has been described as a euphemism for &quot;make America white again.&quot; His focus on race, his support for mass deportation of immigrants, and his crusade against Muslims is not who we really are here in the heartland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much has been written about how the Democratic Party lost the South a half century ago by defying the former Confederate states on civil rights. But nativism and racial animus have never been central to our regional identity, and it is hard to imagine them being so now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, if Trump pushes too far to attract disaffected white men he will likely lose many other voters, especially women and those with more education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The limits on this strategy include the countervailing effect among college-educated voters, Millennials and minorities,&quot; Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg said in The Atlantic's Rust Belt analysis. &quot;But it may be equally important that half of the working class (women) are put off by him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same article, Henry Olsen, a conservative analyst at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, said that what Trump is &quot;doing is offering a voice to those (white working-class) people's beliefs and aspirations in a way that no Republican that has run for president has done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which is why I think he could do better with them, but worse in the suburbs, and that's his challenge. If you do better, for instance, in rural Wisconsin but significantly worse in Madison and small suburbs of Green Bay and the exurbs of Milwaukee ... you don't do overall better. That's the challenge he faces, which is the reverse of the typical Republican challenge; they can speak to suburbanites but they can't speak to these (blue-collar) people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also worth recalling that Ted Cruz handily defeated Trump in Wisconsin's April GOP primary, 48 percent to 35 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My bet is Trump will lose Wisconsin and mostly fail in selling his repugnant political brand to general election voters in other parts of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, I am disappointed that it is even a discussion. For that matter, I am disappointed by the appeal of both Trump and Bernie Sanders, as protest candidates. Both promise to recreate the good old days by blocking or unwinding trade deals, for instance. Their shared message is not that the economy is rapidly evolving and needs nuanced governance, but ? always ? that dark forces are rigging the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can see the effect of this appeal even on a good-government, centrist candidate like Hillary Clinton. Instead of talking about the need for a balancing act on trade, she is focusing mostly on, for example, how Trump's furniture brand is made not in the U.S. but in Turkey. Opined The Economist: &quot;This is good politics, but it makes a gloomy spectacle for those who think trade makes America, and the world, richer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of us believe a brighter economic future requires more than conspiracy theories about immigrants and trade deals. Instead it requires investment in infrastructure, education and job training, coupled with tax incentives and safety nets for individuals, financed by a tax system that recognizes growing wealth disparities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even out here in the land of rust, one can hope.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never, before Donald Trump thrust himself onto the political stage, has a U.S. presidential candidate had such a strong impact on juvenile minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By &quot;juvenile minds&quot; I am not referring to the intellectual capacity of those who might vote for The Donald. Well, not necessarily.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nope, I mean my grandkids, who range in age from four to 10, proud possessors of juvenile minds but not registered Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a recent visit to my place they were gaga for America's great imposter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though many adults no longer find the prospect of a Trump presidency so amusing, my grandkids would crack up at the mere mention of his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seemed every cloud looked like Donald Trump's face, every sunset was the colour of his hair (as if that hue could be found in nature). A knot in a plank might resemble his squinty grimace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last summer, picking up on a careless utterance by their grandfather, they yelled &quot;I'm an idiot!&quot; while plunging offthe dock into chilly lake waters. This summer it has been &quot;Donald&nbsp;Trump!&quot; which amounts to roughly the same thing, I guess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At bedtime, they inserted Donald Trump into their readings of Curious George stories and, perhaps appropriately, books titled The Boy Who Ate the World and Too Many Toys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My grandkidlings have but a hazy idea of who Donald Trump is and what he stands for. I know that because not one of them woke up screaming with night terrors, sobbing &quot;Donald Trump&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;Donald Trump&quot; with such anguish that I had to rub their backs and reassure them that he might not be able to get us in Canada. Anyway, my 10-year-old was the instigator of this summer's trumpery at my place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it soon filtered down the grandchildren chain, as imitation seems to do every summer when these youngsters get together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each tried to trump the other, so to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climactic moment, our equivalent to Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican Convention, came around the bonfire one night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kids, in not-so-flattering imitation of their grandfather, were taking turns inventing &quot;scary&quot; stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most involved some gruesome creature swooping down and devouring children who are wearing, coincidentally, the same clothes that the real children who were listening had just daubed with marshmallows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our four-year-old, who has mastered the format if not the plot elements of the bonfire ghost story, climbed up on the stump that looks like a decaying alligator corpse and took his turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once there was an evil man and he snuck up on the bonfire and he came after a girl in brown and a boy in green and a boy in red and a grandpa drinking a beer&quot; --I may be misquoting him here --&quot;and captured them and took them away.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bipartisan backlash that followed Donald Trump's Friday rally cancellation was swift and harsh, leaving some Republicans backing the real estate mogul's opponents with renewed vigor ahead of Tuesday's primary vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Trump's campaign has been a direct assault on the so-called political establishment forces that were quick to condemn him, leaving it unclear what the long-term results of Trump's University of Illinois Chicago non-rally will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump created that hostile environment,&quot; said state Rep. Ed Sullivan, a Mundelein Republican and backer of Ohio Gov. John Kasich.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He predicted a backlash against Trump. But if there isn't one, Sullivan said, &quot;God help us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative radio host and former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh was among those who was quick to retort. He has not formally backed a presidential candidate but has said he can relate to Trump's push against the Republican establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't just cancel Trump's rally last night,&quot; Walsh posted to Twitter. &quot;They shut down speech. They spit on America. They awakened the silent majority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of Trump's opponents on the Illinois primary ballot -- Kasich, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz criticized Trump swiftly after the cancellation was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with their supporters split and not uniting behind a single alternative, it's unclear if any one of them will be able to overtake Trump's vote totals in Illinois or in Ohio or Florida where more convention delegates are at stake Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A protester at a Trump event at an airport hangar near Dayton, Ohio, on Saturday leapt over a barricade, jumping into the security buffer surrounding the stage from which Trump was speaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer says Thomas Dimassimo of Fairborn, Ohio, has been charged with inducing panic and disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimassimo was stopped by several U.S. Secret Service agents and other officers, but not before making his way to the stage itself. Several Secret Service agents surrounded Trump on stage briefly while Dimassimo was detained and removed from the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a rally later Saturday in St. Lois, Trump told the crowd about the incident and said that, after learning the man's name, one of his &quot;Internet people&quot; discovered something shocking: alleged evidence that linked Dimassimo to Islamic State militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was probably ISIS or ISIS-related. Do you believe it?&quot; Trump asked the crowd. He said that an online search had revealed &quot;the guy is playing all sorts of, let's say music that you wouldn't be liking, dragging an American flag along the sidewalk, making all sorts of gestures, having all sorts of things on the Internet. And he's probably or possibly ISIS-related.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump appeared to be referring to a video, which was posted on his official Twitter account, that shows student protesters stepping on American flags, declaring, &quot;Black Live Matters&quot; and talking to reporters while religious music plays. It appears to be an edited version of a video posted on YouTube in April 2015 captioned, &quot;Students at Wright State University #NotMyFlag protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hassan Hassan, the co-author of the book &quot;ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,&quot; says the video is &quot;definitely not an ISIS video&quot; based on its content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is utterly farcical; the video is incontrovertibly fake and Trump's accusations about it being linked to ISIS serve only to underline the totality of his ignorance on this issue,&quot; said Charles Lister, a fellow at the Middle East Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Saturday night in Kansas City, Missouri as protesters made their mark at his latest rally, Trump seemed to relish the interruptions -- repeatedly ridiculing them as people with a &quot;little weak voice&quot; and saying &quot;go home to mommy.&quot; Even while stirring up his boisterous supporters, he asked security to be &quot;very gentle&quot; when taking the protesters out. About 20 minutes into his remarks, more than a dozen demonstrators were escorted out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, at the St. Patrick's Day parade In Chicago on Saturday, Gov. Bruce Rauner made only brief remarks about the bedlam the night before. He has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race and hasn't said much about Trump's rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no place for violence in our political discourse,&quot; Rauner said, referring to two police officers who were injured, one of whom was hit in the head by a bottle and needed stitches. &quot;I hope the police officers are OK and that they recover quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Protesting and letting people's views be known is fine,&quot; he said. &quot;No place for violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally Thursday in Charleston, W.Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trump family: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, center, with, from left, daughter Tiffany, Donald Trump Jr., daughter Ivanka, and son Eric. In the front row are kai Trump, left, and Donald Trump III, children of Donald Trump Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calamari Matthew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hicks Hope</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump, famous for firing people, now has to make his most important hire - a running mate on the Republican presidential ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump says he doesn't know who he'll choose, but a look at his career as real estate developer, reality TV host and political candidate gives some clues as to how he'll make his decision and what type of person he might tap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although his campaign has yet to establish a selection committee - except to say Ben Carson would be on it - Trump says he wants an experienced politician who can help him with Congress, which doesn't narrow things down much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is clear is that Trump usually hires by gut, not committee. He values capability above experience, aggressiveness above credentials and loyalty above all. Unlike many candid bosses, he accepts candor from employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're good-looking, that's good. If you're family, that's best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump isn't appointing a construction manager or anointing an Apprentice winner. &quot;This is a whole new process at a whole new level,&quot; says Wayne Barrett, a former Village Voice reporter who has investigated Trump's business deals. &quot;He has an eye for business talent. Whether he has one for political talent is another question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael D'Antonio, author of a Trump biography, Never Enough, wonders how Trump will reach his decision: &quot;He'd probably be best served by a sober, deliberative process, but when has he ever had to hire someone who mattered this much?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the types of people Trump traditionally likes to hire:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOVICES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump takes chances on unknowns. Matthew Calamari, the Trump Organization COO, was working security at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in 1981 when Trump spotted him evicting some hecklers and hired him to handle his own security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such hires are less expensive and more loyal, D'Antonio says: &quot;He doesn't require first-tier people. I think he's kind of uncomfortable with them. If he can pluck you from a less prominent place and pay you well, he prefers that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's original campaign staff, which helped pull off one of the biggest upsets in U.S. political history, consisted of &quot;people who would never have been hired to do what they're doing by a campaign that was sane,&quot; Stuart Stevens, strategist for Mitt Romney in 2012, told The Hill this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager, had never run a successful statewide race. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman, was doing Trump corporate PR and had never worked for a political campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's fine with Trump. &quot;He wants diamonds in the rough,&quot; says Gwenda Blair, a biographer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WOMEN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has hired many female executives. They include Norma Foerderer, who was his top assistant, and Barbara Res, construction manager for Trump Tower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naming a woman head of a big construction project was unheard of in 1980. Res says that when Trump hired her, he told her, &quot;Men are better than women, but a good woman is better than 10 men.&quot; His logic: A woman who has succeeded in a sexist system had to be outstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INSIDERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump likes to hire and promote people he knows. &quot;They don't have drug problems, they don't have alcohol problems,&quot; he told Bloomberg last year. &quot;I would rather take guys at a lower level and move them up than hire people that you have no idea who they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calamari rose from security chief to COO. Foerderer, hired as a secretary, became executive vice president. Trump's social media wizard, Justin McConney, is the son of the Trump Organization controller and has been with Trump companies since 2009. A small San Antonio firm that's worked for Trump since 2011 was hired to build the campaign website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump took a liking to Res after he saw the 31-year-old engineer stand up to an architect at a meeting on Trump's first big project, the conversion of the old Commodore Hotel at Grand Central Terminal into a Hyatt. Next thing she knew, she was sitting in his living room listening to his plans for Trump Tower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RELATIVES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump always has relied on family. Ivana, his first wife, helped manage his Atlantic City casinos and ran the Plaza Hotel. Their children - Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric - largely run the Trump Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most corporate websites have biographies of key managers. The Trump Organization's doesn't mention anyone whose last name isn't Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUTH-TELLERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald Kessler, a journalist who met Trump while working on a book about Palm Beach, says he &quot;expects candor in people he hires. It's the one thing that really stands out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to a point. Once a decision has been made, Blair notes, Trump expects complete loyalty - &quot;someone who'll jump when he says jump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADVERSARIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I often hire people that were on the opposing side of a deal that I respect,&quot; Trump told Newsday in 1989. In the early '80s, he sued New York City Housing Commissioner Anthony Gliedman personally for blocking a $25 million tax abatement for Trump Tower. In 1986, after a lunch in Little Italy, Gliedman agreed to join the Trump Organization and leave the administration of Mayor Ed Koch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOOKERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump cares about a prospective hire's hairstyle, weight and attire. The winning Apprentice contestant often was the best-looking. Hicks, the spokeswoman, is a former model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Trump, attractive equals successful, D'Antonio says: &quot;It's very important that someone look the part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHARACTERS ... AS IN STORIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump likes hires with a good back story. Gliedman's showed Trump's willingness to bury the hatchet. Res' showed his focus on talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump &quot;believes in the power of story,&quot; D'Antonio says, &quot;especially a surprising one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOW DOES HE DO IT?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As instructive as who Trump has hired over the years is how: instinctively, quickly, personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't rely on r&eacute;sum&eacute;s or references. &quot;He believes in nothing more than he believes in his gut,&quot; D'Antonio says. Res says it's simple: &quot;He sees people, he likes 'em, he hires 'em.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1981, Trump hired Foerderer, who had no experience in the private sector, let alone real estate, based on a meeting that lasted five minutes. She served him for more than two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a presidential nominee choosing a running mate, Trump's hiring patterns and practices have some pros and many cons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He can't pick a relative, an employee or a novice. Good looks don't count. Trump's limited number of politician supporters don't offer much gravitas, except possibly Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A methodical vetting could be essential if Trump doesn't want a running mate who will blow up in his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Intuitively is not how it's done anymore,&quot; says Joel Goldstein, a St. Louis University Law School expert on the vice presidency. &quot;And when it was, the people involved had served together and knew each other very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Res says, &quot;He will listen to his advisers. There's too much at stake not to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D'Antonio agrees but wonders if Trump is too much like a rebellious teenager: &quot;If he can do what everyone says he shouldn't and get away with it, he wants to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potential vice presidential candidates could be leery of going down with Trump's pirate ship or serving under such a notorious micromanager and spotlight hog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton leads in general election polls, the kind of hiring &quot;good story&quot; Trump likes might come in handy - like Marco Rubio, whom Trump relentlessly derided as &quot;Little Marco,&quot; joining the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't scoff, D'Antonio says: &quot;Trump is the most manipulative person in the world. He's capable of persuading almost anyone, who's even a bit receptive, to join his ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kessler says Trump himself doesn't hold grudges. In Palm Beach, for example, he made peace with private clubs who opposed his conversion of his Mara-Lago estate into one. And he's reached a rapprochement with Fox News' Megyn Kelly, with whom he's feuded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as Kessler is concerned, the point is moot - &quot;I'm sure he's already decided in his mind who it will be.&quot; Kessler's sure it's Rubio. And he's sure Trump can hire him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Christian' Trump supporters need to reread Bible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you consider yourself to be a Bible-believing Christian and support Donald Trump, you should Google a fellow conservative Christian (or so he claims) named Ken Shupe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Shupe owns a towing business in Asheville, North Carolina, and was called to tow the car of a woman named Casey McWade who is arthritic and needed help. While hooking up her car, he noted a Bernie bumper sticker and then claimed that God told him not to help her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Shupe is a Donald Trump supporter. Donald Trump, who wants to bring back waterboarding and worse forms of torture. Donald Trump, who wants to deport 11 million undocumented folks. Donald Trump, who wants to ban Muslims from the country. Donald Trump, who believes women who have an abortion -- a legal procedure -- should be punished. Donald Trump, who publicly mocked a handicapped person. And there are many more un-Christian utterances from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who support him should be called Trumpian evangelicals, since the message he espouses bears no resemblance to the Christ of the New Testament. If you call yourself an evangelical Christian, I challenge you to read the Sermon on the Mount and Jesus' parable of the good Samaritan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would take mental gymnastics to continue to support Mr. Trump. Since Mr. Trump, when interviewed, couldn't come up with any favorite verses from the Bible -- his favorite book -- perhaps Trumpian evangelicals need a little help finding the sermon and the parable. If you can find your Bible, read Matthew chapters 5-7, Luke chapter 10, and verses 25-37.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump is very likely going to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take three deep breaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know we've been on this path for a long time, but it's still hard getting your head around the idea, isn't it?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just to ease the transition, our first-ever exclusively Donald Trump quiz:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After his big string of victories this week, Trump appeared on MSNBC's &quot;Morning Joe,&quot; where he was asked who his foreign policy advisers were. He said ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. &quot;I'm speaking with a lot of generals. Very impressive people. All winners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. &quot;I'm speaking with myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. &quot;I have a long list. It's a good list. Vladimir Putin said it was the best list he'd ever seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. After making his surprise endorsement, Ben Carson said that there were &quot;two different Donald Trumps&quot; and that the private one was &quot;very cerebral.&quot; Asked about that comment, Trump replied ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. &quot;I think there are two Donald Trumps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. &quot;I don't think there are two Donald Trumps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. &quot;I think there are two Donald Trumps ... I don't think there are two Donald Trumps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Trump claimed on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; that there was &quot;nobody that's done so much for equality as I have.&quot; As an example he pointed to ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. His endorsements by Mike Tyson and Dennis Rodman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. The black guy who won &quot;The Apprentice&quot; in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. His $100,000-membership club, Mar-a-Lago - &quot;totally open to everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. After a protester rushed the stage at one of his rallies, Trump claimed the man was associated with ISIS, and retweeted a video of him holding a gun in front of the ISIS flag. When NBC's Chuck Todd pointed out that it was a hoax, Trump said ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. &quot;Whoops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. &quot;All I know is what's on the Internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. &quot;As Kierkegaard said, 'The truth is a trap.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Trump defended the supporter who sucker-punched a protester being led away by security. He said the attack was justified because the protester ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Had violently attacked an elderly woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Had tried to grab one of the officer's guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Was &quot;sticking a certain finger up in the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. House Speaker Paul Ryan scored a great triumph at the end of 2015 when the House passed a compromise spending bill. At a recent rally in North Carolina, Trump said the bill was bad because ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. &quot;The appropriation for infrastructure repair is inadequate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. &quot;It fails to address the really critical Puerto Rican oil export issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. &quot;It funds ISIS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. After Trump defended the use of torture against suspected terrorists, his son Eric, who was campaigning for him, pointed out that waterboarding ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. &quot;Is no different than what happens on college campuses in frat houses every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. &quot;Has real efficacy when employed as a last resort in isolated incidences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. &quot;Is no worse than what China's doing to our manufacturing base.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's presidential rivals have revealed that they are ganging up on the billionaire to stop him becoming the Republican candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In two co-ordinated statements, Ted Cruz and John Kasich said they would work tactically together in elections for the good of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cruz, a Texas senator, will focus all of his resources in Indiana while Mr Kasich, the governor of Ohio, will pile into Oregon and New Mexico. The unlikely alliance is an acknowledgement that the only way they can stop Mr Trump is by plotting against him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frontrunner's response came swiftly when he wrote on Twitter: &quot;Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey Lewandowski: Donald Trump's campaign manager charged with assault</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump now has 845 of the delegates who choose the Republican presidential nominee, Mr Cruz has 559 and Mr Kasich has 148.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A candidate must have 1,237 delegates by the time the Republican National Convention is held in July to automatically win the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should nobody have that number there would be a complicated series of votes in which delegates can back a candidate other than their first-round choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cruz and Mr Kasich feel that if this were to happen they could talk delegates around to voting for them instead of Mr Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five states - Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Connecticut - will hold their primaries tomorrow and Mr Trump is expected to win comfortably, but his rivals are looking ahead to Indiana in particular, which is a winner-takes-all state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night Mr Cruz's campaign manager Jeff Roe said in a statement: &quot;To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly afterwards John Weaver, a strategist for Mr Kasich, put out a statement which said: &quot;Keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already, and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign's resources west and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump's insurgent campaign has rocked the Republican party thanks to his controversial comments on immigration, women and attacks on other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also spawned a &quot;Never Trump&quot; movement among moderate Republicans who are determined to deny him the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr Trump and Mr Cruz were dealt a blow after one of the Republican party's biggest donors said Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton might make a better US president than either of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with ABC News, billionaire Charles Koch described policies put forward by them as &quot;reminiscent of Nazi Germany&quot;, &quot;monstrous&quot; and &quot;frightening&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Koch was talking about Mr Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US and to create a register, and Mr Cruz's promise to &quot;carpet bomb&quot; areas of the Middle East controlled by Islamic State.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The businessman and reality TV star announced on Twitter that he would be dropping by his Doonbeg resort in Co Clare - just days after Enda Kenny branded some of his remarks &quot;racist and dangerous.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his official Twitter account, Trump announced:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip comes at the same time as Vice President Joe Biden will be coming to Ireland at the invitation of the Taoiseach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a few days ago Enda Kenny branded some of Mr Trump's speeches as &quot;racist and dangerous&quot; during Taoiseach's questions at a Dail sitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the comments in response to questions by Opposition TDs about Ireland's position should Mr Trump be elected US President next November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taoiseach's comments came after a question from People Before Profit Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett on the use of Shannon Airport by US troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kenny was asked about speeches made by Mr Trump on immigration and he replied: &quot;If Trump's comments are racist and dangerous, which they are, there is an alternative to vote for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more: 5 very Donald Trump things he said about Ireland as he secures Republican candidacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Taoiseach insisted he would not tolerate any kind of travel ban imposed on Irish citizens because of their religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kenny said, &quot;I would not tolerate any situation where either religion or discrimination would apply in terms of proposals from another leader/government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this country, we have been very free about these matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice-President Biden's trip to Ireland was announced in May when Mr Kenny said the Vice President would be accepting a long-standing invitation and would be &quot;coming home&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Biden has family links in Mayo and Louth and he is also planning to visit Dublin during what is understood to be a four day visit in late June.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump has decided to visit Ireland next month - at the same time as Vice President Joe Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The businessman and reality TV star announced on Twitter that he would be dropping by his Doonbeg resort in Co Clare - just days after Enda Kenny branded some of his remarks &quot;racist and dangerous.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his official Twitter account, Trump announced:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump 2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump 3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump is expected to be formally named as the Republican Party nominee at its national convention in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before that he will visit his Doonbeg Lodge resort on the coast of Co Clare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more: Donald Trump's comments are &quot;racist and dangerous&quot; the Taoiseach has sensationally claimed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip comes at the same time as Vice President Joe Biden will be coming to Ireland at the invitation of the Taoiseach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a few days ago Enda Kenny branded some of Mr Trump's speeches as &quot;racist and dangerous&quot; during Taoiseach's questions at a Dail sitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the comments in response to questions by Opposition TDs about Ireland's position should Mr Trump be elected US President next November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taoiseach's comments came after a question from People Before Profit Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett on the use of Shannon Airport by US troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kenny was asked about speeches made by Mr Trump on immigration and he replied: &quot;If Trump's comments are racist and dangerous, which they are, there is an alternative to vote for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more: 5 very Donald Trump things he said about Ireland as he secures Republican candidacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Taoiseach insisted he would not tolerate any kind of travel ban imposed on Irish citizens because of their religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kenny said, &quot;I would not tolerate any situation where either religion or discrimination would apply in terms of proposals from another leader/government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this country, we have been very free about these matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice-President Biden's trip to Ireland was announced in May when Mr Kenny said the Vice President would be accepting a long-standing invitation and would be &quot;coming home&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Biden has family links in Mayo and Louth and he is also planning to visit Dublin during what is understood to be a four day visit in late June.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madison: Democratic Party has issued the following news release:<BR><BR>  <BR><BR>  It doesn't matter if Donald Trump insults Gold Star parents, calls for a ban on Muslims entering the country, suggests his second amendment supporters could stop Sec. Hillary Clinton, or says that Sec. Clinton and President Obama are the co-founders of ISIS, Rep. Sean Duffy can't ever seem to disagree with Donald Trump - ever.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR> While other Republicans are holding their noses as they support Donald Trump, Sean Duffy can't seem to get enough of the Republican nominee's dangerous, bigoted, and divisive language.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> In a recent interview, Sean Duffy was asked repeatedly if he agrees with Trump's comments that President Obama and Hillary Clinton are the co-founders of ISIS. Over and over again, Duffy couldn't bring himself to break with Donald Trump, until eventually conceding, saying &quot;no, he isn't on the ground.&quot; But, of course, Duffy found a way to agree with Trump's dangerous language, following up by saying Donald Trump's comment &quot;makes the point.&quot;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> Sean Duffy didn't stop there, he blamed the media for &quot;splicing and dicing&quot; Trump's words, despite his nominee directly saying &quot;he [President Obama] is the founder of ISIS...he gets the most valuable player award, him and Hillary, she gets it too, I give him co-founder.&quot; Just like Donald Trump, Rep. Duffy scapegoats the media or anyone else to defend his illogical and false arguments.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> Earlier in the interview, Sean Duffy was asked about Donald Trump's comments to supporters saying they can stop Hillary Clinton by shooting her, to which Duffy responded &quot;he says what he means.&quot; This came moments after Duffy begged Trump to &quot;stay on script&quot; and &quot;read from the teleprompter.&quot; Like the rest of us, Sean Duffy knows that Donald Trump can't be forced to say things he doesn't believe, making Duffy's support of Trump's dangerous rhetoric and agenda even more troubling.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> By his own admission, Duffy believes Donald Trump doesn't mince words and there is nothing to parse in his dangerous and sometimes violent rhetoric. That means when Trump insults Gold Star parents he means it; when Trump says we should ban all Muslims from the country he means it; when Trump says his supporters can stop Hillary Clinton by shooting her he means it; and when Trump says Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are the co-founders of ISIS he means it.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> &quot;Sean Duffy doesn't care that Donald Trump's dangerous language is deliberate and could have very serious and grave consequences. Sean Duffy will say or do anything to support Donald Trump, even if that means ignoring people's safety,&quot; Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Martha Laning said on Monday. &quot;We can have our political differences, but for Sean Duffy to not challenge the violent rhetoric Donald Trump has spouted is shameful and has no place in Wisconsin or the United States.&quot;<BR><BR>  <BR><BR> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com <BR><BR>  <BR><BR>  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump is very likely going to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take three deep breaths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I know we've been on this path for a long time, but it's still hard getting your head around the idea, isn't it? Just to ease the transition, our first-ever exclusively Donald Trump quiz:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1) After his big string of victories this week, Trump appeared on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe,'' where he was asked who his foreign policy advisers were. He said:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''I'm speaking with a lot of generals. Very impressive people. All winners.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''I'm speaking with myself.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''I have a long list. It's a good list. Vladimir Putin said it was the best list he'd ever seen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2) After making his surprise endorsement, Ben Carson said that there were ''two different Donald Trumps'' and that the private one was ''very cerebral.'' Asked about that comment, Trump replied:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''I think there are two Donald Trumps.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''I don't think there are two Donald Trumps.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''I think there are two Donald Trumps ... I don't think there are two Donald Trumps.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3) Trump claimed on ''Good Morning America'' that there was ''nobody that's done so much for equality as I have.'' As an example he pointed to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) His endorsements by Mike Tyson and Dennis Rodman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) The black guy who won ''The Apprentice'' in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) His $100,000-membership club, Mar-a-Lago -- ''totally open to everybody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4) After a protester rushed the stage at one of his rallies, Trump claimed the man was associated with ISIS, and retweeted a video of him holding a gun in front of the ISIS flag. When NBC's Chuck Todd pointed out that it was a hoax, Trump said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''Whoops.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''All I know is what's on the Internet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''As Kierkegaard said, 'The truth is a trap.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5) One of the groups that's been opening Trump rallies is USA Freedom Kids, little girls who sang about ''President Trump'' who ''knows how to make America great ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''... And give us schools that really rate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''... Teach us to love and not to hate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''... Deal from strength or get crushed every time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  6) Trump defended the supporter who sucker-punched a protester being led away by security forces. He said the attack was justified because the protester:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) Had violently attacked an elderly woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) Had tried to grab one of the officer's guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) Was ''sticking a certain finger up in the air.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  7) House Speaker Paul Ryan scored a great triumph at the end of 2015 when the House passed a compromise spending bill that keeps the government running through the fall. Trump has been loudly critical, and at a recent rally in North Carolina, he said the bill was bad because:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''The appropriation for infrastructure repair is inadequate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''It fails to address the really critical Puerto Rican oil export issue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''It funds ISIS.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  8) Sarah Palin had to leave the Trump campaign to be with her husband, who had a serious snowmobile accident. Before her departure she said Todd's multiple injuries made her appreciate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''The skill of Alaskan emergency treatment centers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''The time that we have to spend in doing something so worthy, and that's to get Donald J. Trump elected president.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''The stress my family has undergone due to my unflagging pursuit of celebrity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  9) After Trump defended the use of torture against suspected terrorists, his son Eric, who was campaigning for him, pointed out that waterboarding:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''Is no different than what happens on college campuses in frat houses every day.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''Has real efficacy when employed as a last resort in isolated incidences.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''Is no worse than what China's doing to our manufacturing base.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  10) Since he threw his support behind Trump, Gov. Chris Christie has been humiliated on a daily basis for everything -- from his slavish stare at the candidate's press conferences to widespread criticism of his absence from New Jersey while he toils on the campaign trail. To pay him back, at a pre-primary event this week, Trump:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) Made fun of Christie for the absentee thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) Announced he was indeed planning to make Christie secretary of transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) Invited Christie to tell the audience about all the things he went through on 9/11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  11) Trump has endlessly complained about the way immigrants steal jobs from American workers, but he's used loopholes in federal law to hire foreign workers himself. At a recent debate he argued that voters wouldn't care about that seeming contradiction because:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''Everybody would like a Romanian helper.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''Nobody knows the system better than me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''What happens in Mar-a-Lago stays in Mar-a-Lago.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ANSWERS: 1-B, 2-C, 3-C, 4-B, 5-C, 6-C, 7-C, 8-B, 9-A, 10-A, 11-B</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two parties </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two parties, June 13 -- The two parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, both now have their presumptive nominees for the November 08 presidential election weeks ahead of their respective national conventions. Even recently, there were serious speculations in the media that both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would have to fight until their respective convention to become their respective party's candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama appeared on MSNBC TV's popular Tonight Show after Hillary Clinton won the June 07 California primary and became the presumptive candidate of the Democratic Party. The interviewer Jimmy Fallon asked the President whether the Republicans were happy to have chosen Donald Trump as their candidate. The President answered spontaneously that he did not know about the Republicans but that he was certain that the Democrats were indeed happy much to the cheer of the audience that was present in the TV station watching the interview live. The President was no doubt underlining the feeling in the Hillary Clinton camp that with the type of problems Donald Trump's candidature is stuck where his own party leaders have called him &quot;racist&quot; after his attack on Judge Gonzalo Curiel for his Mexican heritage, it would be easy sailing for the former Secretary of State.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President thereafter paused. He then expressed views that underlined why he is, the inexplicable hatred of his opposition to him notwithstanding, a great president and perhaps the best that the country has seen for a long time of issues of morals and their importance in politics. He said that the America is a great and democratic country for a variety of reasons among which the way the country has based its politics on the two-party system is a very important one. He said that the Democrats have been left of centre while the Republicans, right of the centre and from those positions they for generations differed fiercely on principles, argued strongly on issues but in the end came together on what was important for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He thought that Donald Trump's candidature has been breaking that two-party system and endangering the welfare of the country. He hoped that somewhere down the race for the White House, the Republican Party would come together or that Donald Trump would change his style so that the two-party system he has been destroying would be saved and the country's democratic stability and future assured. The President's thoughts on the two-party system underlined the spirit of bipartisanship that has figured ahead of party interests in the way he ran the country in his two terms as the President. It also underlined, notwithstanding the casual way he stated it, that with an unreformed Donald Trump and a Republican Party unable to reform him, Hillary Clinton would have no serious contest for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President could be right because Donald Trump's candidature is now sinking over his fight with Judge Curiel who is investigating fraud in the activities of the Trump University. The Republican Party establishment widely condemned the remark. House Speaker Paul Ryan said that Donald Trump's comment on the Judge was &quot;textbook definition of a racist comment.&quot; The hue and cry from the Republican establishment failed to have any effect on Donald Trump who has remained unrepentant. Outside the party, very few had any doubt about Donald Trump as a racist from his repeated remarks on Muslims, blacks, Latino-Hispanics and immigrants. With the Republican Party establishment itself now accepting the dangerously damaging view, it is not difficult to understand why there was a smile on the President's face when he answered Jimmy Fallon's question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, some Republicans are jumping the Republican ship now that the candidature of Donald Trump is a reality. In the 1/3rd Senate seats that would be contested on November 08, there are quite a few where the Republican candidates are facing tough contests. For these Republicans, the racial nature of Donald Trump's campaign against the minorities, particularly the Latino-Hispanic, has become a nightmare. As a consequence, some of these Republicans are distancing themselves from Donald Trump by &quot;un-endorsing&quot; their earlier endorsements for him. Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois withdrew his endorsement with the following statement: &quot;After much consideration, I have concluded that Donald Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to assume the greatest office in the world.&quot; David Johnson, a state senator in Iowa, left the Reublican Party altogether with the statement that he &quot;would not stand silent if the party of Lincoln and the end of slavery buckles under the racial bias of a bigot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this stage, it appears like Donald Trump has bitten more than he can chew with his racial and religious bigotry. Now it is not only the rest of the country outside the Republican Party that is jittery with him and his candidature; within the party that feeling has now becoming widespread. In fact, with the anger on Donald Trump over his ill-advised comments on Judge Curiel now inflamed over his refusal to apologise, the Republican Party leadership is now seriously considering the alternative to nominating him as the candidate. That would of course be difficult because Donald Trump has already collected, democratically, the required number of delegates to take the Republican nomination in the party's convention in Cleveland, Ohio from July 18-21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump has also totally confused the Republican Party leaders. This has been amply underlined by Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell in a new Bloomberg Politics podcast recently. In that, the Senator said that Donald Trump &quot;needs someone highly experienced and very knowledgeable because it's pretty obvious he doesn't know a lot about the issues.&quot; The Senator said he had reached that conclusion after watching him &quot;in the debates in which he had participated.&quot; He disagreed with everything Donald Trump has said on the campaign trail and that he &quot;vehemently objected&quot; to his attacks on various ethnic groups. The Senator felt that the problem with Donald Trump thus far has been the fact that he did not speak publicly from the script and that once in the White House &quot;he'll have to respond to the right-of-centre world which elected him, and the things that we believe in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senator, however, had nothing to state how Donald Trump would be encouraged to follow the script. He also did not explain how the damage that Donald Trump's public utterances had already caused his candidature and the party would be repaired. Instead, he said he was &quot;comfortable supporting him&quot; and that once in the White House, would &quot;respond to the right of the centre world that elected him.&quot; There are so many gaps in the Senator's assumptions and conclusions that it only underlines the utter confusion in the Republican Party with Donald Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan after calling Donald Trump a racist went on to state that to defeat Hillary Clinton, he too would support Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, the Republican Party leadership is in the predicament where they are being forced to back a candidate who has now won himself the trademark of a racist candidate by its own admission. Donald Trump has no confusions or worries about his well-deserved trademark. He has shown no signs of retracting any of his remarks and beliefs that have won him that trademark. It is up to America to decide whether, on November 08, it would be willing to elect such a candidate to the White House. There are millions of racists in the United States. However, it is unlikely even a majority of them, who have thus far energised his campaign, would now be willing to be themselves labelled racist as they surely would if they now vote for him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In America, the battle to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee is growing evermore bitter - not to mention childish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Donald Trump's rivals, Marco Rubio, has even taunted him for having &quot;small hands&quot;. Trump responded, live on TV, by shouting, &quot;Look at those hands! Are they small hands? He referred to my hands - 'If they're small, something else must be small.' I guarantee you there's no problem! I guarantee!&quot; For the benefit of readers who missed the latest Republican TV debate, we present a transcript of the highlights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ted Cruz: &quot;It's vital that we keep this debate serious and mature, and don't stoop to making personal attacks. Only a douchebag like Donald would do that.&quot; Marco Rubio: &quot;I agree. We've got to focus on the issues that matter to the American people. And the most important issue is this. Donald Trump just wet his pants. Miss! Miss! Donald Trump just wet his pants, Miss!&quot; Donald Trump: &quot;Did not! Miss, I did not just wet my pants! Don't listen to Rubio, Miss! He's a rotten smelly liar. I didn't wet my pants, I didn't! You take that back.&quot; Ben Carson: &quot;I'm sorry, Donald, but the facts speak for themselves. Your pants are at their wettest since records began, having increased in wetness by 34 per cent year on year.&quot; Donald Trump: &quot;That is a total misrepresentation of the facts. The true figure is less than half that. Because the reality is, I am a big boy now. I can tie my shoes, I can go to the bathroom by myself, and I can do my times tables all the way up to 10 times 10. Unlike Ted Cruz, who by the way is afraid of the dark.&quot; Ted Cruz: &quot;That is a scandalous slur. I am not afraid of the dark. I just like to keep the bedroom light on, in case I wake up and suddenly feel like doing some reading. But I think the key question that the American people are asking is this. Donald Trump, is it true that you've never kissed a girl?&quot; Donald Trump: &quot;This is exactly the kind of garbage that proves the elites are running scared of me. Of course I've kissed a girl.&quot; Ted Cruz: &quot;Oh yeah? Who was she?&quot; Donald Trump: &quot;You wouldn't know her, she goes to another school. But let me make this important point. Alosersayswhat.&quot; Ted Cruz: &quot;What?&quot; Donald Trump: &quot;Ha ha ha ha! I said, 'A loser says what', and Ted Cruz said, 'What'! Ted Cruz is a loser!&quot; Ted Cruz: &quot;I know you are. But what am I?&quot; John Kasich: &quot;Come on, guys. This is immature.&quot; Donald Trump: &quot;Your mom's immature.&quot; John Kasich: &quot;That doesn't even make sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump: &quot;Your mom doesn't make sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marco Rubio: &quot;Shut up, Trump, you big baby.&quot; Donald Trump: &quot;Right, that's it. If you call me a big baby one more time, I'm going to go and tell my dad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight years ago, Mrs Obama said: &quot;And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: like, you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, that you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never, before Donald Trump thrust himself onto the political stage, has a U.S. presidential candidate had such a strong impact on juvenile minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By &quot;juvenile minds&quot; I am not referring to the intellectual capacity of those who might vote for The Donald. Well, not necessarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nope, I mean my grandkids, who range in age from 4 to 10, proud possessors of juvenile minds but not registered Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a recent visit to my place they were gaga for America's great imposter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though many adults no longer find the prospect of a Trump presidency so amusing, my grandkids would crack up at the mere mention of his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seemed every cloud looked like Donald Trump's face, every sunset was the colour of his hair (as if that hue could be found in nature). A knot in a plank might resemble his squinty grimace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last summer, picking up on a careless utterance by their grandfather, they yelled &quot;I'm an idiot!&quot; while plunging off the dock into chilly lake waters. This summer it has been &quot;Donald&nbsp;Trump!&quot; which amounts to roughly the same thing, I guess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At bedtime, they inserted Donald Trump into their readings of Curious George stories and, perhaps appropriately, books titled The Boy Who Ate the World and Too Many Toys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My grandkidlings have but a hazy idea of who Donald Trump is and what he stands for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know that because not one of them woke up screaming with night terrors, sobbing &quot;Donald Trump&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;Donald Trump&quot; with such anguish that I had to rub their backs and reassure them that he might not be able to get us in Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But like comedians dropping the F-bomb, they know they can get a cheap laugh merely by uttering the name of that American national joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there's a long tradition of children's innocent amusements being rooted in serious events of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, nursery rhymes often have a deeper, darker meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ring Around a Rosie is about the black plague, apparently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oranges and Lemons traces the route of a condemned man whose head is then chopped off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Mary Quite Contrary refers to the tortures inflicted on Protestants by England's Queen Mary l. The silver bells in her garden of pain are thumbscrews. The cockle shells attach to other appendages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humpty Dumpty was a large cannon used by the army of Charles l. When singing your infant to sleep with Rock-a-Bye Baby you might be suggesting that the heir to the throne of King James ll is somebody else's child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, my 10-year-old was the instigator of this summer's trumpery at my place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it soon filtered down the grandchildren chain, as imitation seems to do every summer when these youngsters get together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each tried to trump the other, so to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climactic moment, our equivalent to Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican Convention, came around the bonfire one night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kids, in not-so-flattering imitation of their grandfather, were taking turns inventing &quot;scary&quot; stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most involved some gruesome creature swooping down and devouring children who are wearing, coincidentally, the same clothes that the real children who were listening had just daubed with marshmallows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our four-year-old, who has mastered the format if not the plot elements of the bonfire ghost story, climbed up on the stump that looks like a decaying alligator corpse and took his turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once there was an evil man and he snuck up on the bonfire and he came after a girl in brown and a boy in green and a boy in red and a grandpa drinking a beer&quot; - I may be misquoting him here - &quot;and captured them and took them away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And his name was DONALD TWUMP!&quot; While the rest of us we were all collapsed with laughter, I think the little guy helped himself to an extra piece of smore chocolate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe he knows more about Trump than I was giving him credit for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GRANDPARENTS often tell each other that if they'd known how much fun grandparenting was going to be they would have skipped being parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caring for kids is a lot of responsibility. That's especially true for those of us who grandparent on our own and can't just dump the kids on a partner whenever it grows tiresome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ultimate responsibility for children usually rests with parents. No one's likely to blame me if one of my grandkids grows up to be a politician instead of a productive member of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After sharing notes with other grandparents, I've concluded a big part of the joy of grandparenting lies in the anticipation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We look forward to their coming. We look forward to their finally falling asleep. We look forward to their departure. And then, when we've caught up on our sleep and cleaned up the mess, we start looking forward to their next visit. During intervals when we don't see them, we look forward to how they will have grown and what new skills they will have developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents, on the other hand, have the kids almost all the time. They might get to anticipate the arrival of their children only before they are born and their departure only when applying for a bank loan for tuition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their next moment of anticipation after that might be when junior moves back into their basement after seven years of study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's unless they have grandparents handy. Despatching the kids to grandpa's or grandma's house periodically gives parents a chance to appreciate how much their young ones are changing and to look forward to having them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, in thankfully rare cases, to move without leaving a forwarding address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We grandparents are the plover birds to their crocodiles, feeding ourselves while they get their teeth cleaned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if parents have to wean their kids of a few bad habits and a sugar dependency when they return home, I'd say that's a small price to pay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Add the name of Dennis Hastert to the seemingly infinite list of Illinois politicians who have brought shame to our fine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Illinois should be known as home to Abraham Lincoln, Everett Dirksen, President Barack Obama and Joseph Cannon. Instead, we are known throughout the nation for an endless stream of governors, members of Congress, state legislators and local officials who have committed egregious offenses that offend the cause of public service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Christian' Trump supporters need to reread Bible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you consider yourself to be a Bible-believing Christian and support Donald Trump, you should Google a fellow conservative Christian (or so he claims) named Ken Shupe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Shupe owns a towing business in Asheville, North Carolina, and was called to tow the car of a woman named Casey McWade who is arthritic and needed help. While hooking up her car, he noted a Bernie bumper sticker and then claimed that God told him not to help her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Shupe is a Donald Trump supporter. Donald Trump, who wants to bring back waterboarding and worse forms of torture. Donald Trump, who wants to deport 11 million undocumented folks. Donald Trump, who wants to ban Muslims from the country. Donald Trump, who believes women who have an abortion -- a legal procedure -- should be punished. Donald Trump, who publicly mocked a handicapped person. And there are many more un-Christian utterances from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who support him should be called Trumpian evangelicals, since the message he espouses bears no resemblance to the Christ of the New Testament. If you call yourself an evangelical Christian, I challenge you to read the Sermon on the Mount and Jesus' parable of the good Samaritan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would take mental gymnastics to continue to support Mr. Trump. Since Mr. Trump, when interviewed, couldn't come up with any favorite verses from the Bible -- his favorite book -- perhaps Trumpian evangelicals need a little help finding the sermon and the parable. If you can find your Bible, read Matthew chapters 5-7, Luke chapter 10, and verses 25-37.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NC governor acting to preserve moral decency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the moment North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and the General Assembly voted to overturn Charlotte's transgender bathroom ordinance, there has been widespread reaction across the nation. Recently, Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, has thanked McCrory for doing the right thing and standing strong in defense of the recently passed law that prevents people from using a restroom or locker room that does not match their biological identity. Franklin Graham and others are speaking out in favor of this decision to safeguard citizens and preserve moral decency in this nation. Pro-family individuals should continue to defend God's standard of human sexuality and oppose the advancement of the sexual revolution values into mainstream society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have friends who have transgender children. These parents pray for and love their children unconditionally without compromising their faith, and there is hope for those who struggle in the LGBT lifestyle. This is not only a national issue but is a spiritual and moral issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year Franklin Graham is traveling to all 50 states to encourage Christians to live out their faith and to pray fervently for our entire nation. As a part of the decisionamericatour.com, Franklin Graham will be coming to the state Capitol to lead a prayer rally on June 14 at noon. Everyone is invited to attend this free event. &quot;America is at a crossroads, and I believe we should take every opportunity to stand up for the things of God and His Word.&quot; -Franklin Graham.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madison: Democratic Party has issued the following news release:<BR><BR>  <BR><BR>  During a Friday interview with conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said &quot;of course&quot; there is something Donald Trump could do to make him pull his endorsement of the Republican nominee. When asked exactly what that something is Ryan said, &quot;where that line gets crossed - I don't know where that is.&quot;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> Wisconsinites are also wondering where that line is for Speaker Ryan. Mr. Trump has mocked a disabled reporter, said John McCain is not a war hero because he was captured, wants to ban people from immigrating to America based on their religion, claimed a federal judge's ethnicity prevents him from doing his job, wanted congratulations for anticipating the worst mass shooting in U.S. history and even advocated for the murder the wives and children of terrorists. Just this week he disrespected the grieving parents of an American war hero and was caught making false claims on countless occasions. Each and every time Speaker Ryan has responded with empty explanations and more often, silence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;Donald Trump has crossed every line there is - except, apparently, Paul Ryan's line.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> Other Wisconsin Republicans have been similarly desperate to thread the needle with Mr. Trump, condemning his behavior but never doing anything about it. That may be because many of Donald Trump's ideas are exactly in line with the policies Republicans have established in Wisconsin.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> Since taking office in 2010, Governor Walker and the Republican-controlled legislature have been diligently working to take the same kind of hateful, misogynistic and regressive ideas we hear in Donald Trump's speeches and turn them into law.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> From assaulting women's reproductive rights to attempting to denying minority, elderly and low-income Wisconsinites the right to vote, Wisconsin Republicans have demonstrated that they are more ideologically aligned with Donald Trump's offensive ideas than they are willing to publicly admit. The only difference is that Wisconsin Republicans prefer to accomplish their dangerous policy goals in backrooms with the support of billionaire special interests, while Donald Trump shouts out his outrageous policies on the national stage.  <BR><BR>  <BR><BR> &quot;Paul Ryan and Wisconsin Republican leaders either share Donald Trump's principles, or lack the political courage to stand up to his hateful and divisive rhetoric. No matter which it is, they are letting down the people of this state and throwing their support behind a man who is temperamentally unfit to be President.&quot; said Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Martha Laning.<BR><BR>  <BR><BR> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com <BR><BR>  <BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when former California Republican gubernatorial candidate and Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman claims not only will she would never vote for Donald Trump, but she considers him no better than a fascist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in big trouble as a candidate for president because after the nominee normally receives the endorsement from both their party's Senate majority leader as well as their congressional house speaker, both endorsees don't usually go out of their way to inform the press they ought not be surprised if in the future said endorsements are not, in fact, rescinded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when both Don King and Ben Roethlisberger, whom Trump had loudly and proudly proclaimed were supporting his campaign, both reported to the press they had offered no such support.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when the press simply rolls its eyes in unison each and every time he tries to revive the old canards that President Barack Obama was either not really born in the United States or is currently a secret practitioner of the Muslim faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when the overwhelming reaction from neutral observers regarding his first social-media post following the Orlando nightclub massacre was, as usual, about himself and not about the innocent victims who were massacred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president because it has become quite clear the more the press investigates his business practices from his past, the more obvious it is to all that his bloviating about his alleged past successes are at best inflated, and at worst simply untrue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when folks like William Johnson, the head of the whites-only American Freedom Party, publicly laud him as &quot;the great white hope&quot; for America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when such noted political figures as former Republican Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush; 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney; and scores of current or formally elected Republican leaders decide it's better to stay home watching the Cleveland Convention from the privacy of their bedrooms than to attend the event in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when one of the most respected U.S. Senators from either party, Republican Susan Collins of Maine, admits that she could easily find herself casting her ballot this year for her former U.S. Senate colleague, Democrat Hillary Clinton, rather than her party's presumptive nominee Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when former California Republican gubernatorial candidate and Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman claims not only will she would never vote for Donald Trump, but she considers him no better than a fascist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for president when his most ardent defender on CNN News, Jeffrey Lord, was so over the top in trying to make the case that Trump had not made racist comments, that his lame defense became a national story of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble when yet a second passionate defender, Katrina Pierson, made the ultimate faux pas of claiming the Indiana judge, whose parents immigrated legally from Mexico decades ago, was a member of a partisan anti-Trump group called National Council of La Raza when in fact he was a member of the California La Raza Lawyers Association, a nonpartisan legal organization. Oops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Donald Trump should realize he's in trouble as a candidate for President because it seems the only three ways for him to win this election are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Either for a majority of this year's voters to turn out to be 60-plus years old, white, high-school-educated men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If Republicans can massively suppress the vote in a half dozen key swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. He can pick up the support of disillusioned Bernie Sanders partisans, even though they disagree with him on abortion rights, the death penalty, gay marriage, global warming and immigration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Paul Ryan offers to step down as GOP convention chair if Donald Trump asks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubio, who in March ended his campaign for the party's nomination, made it abundantly clear that he was not at all interested in being drafted in as Trump pick for vice-president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Facebook post Rubio wrote: &quot;I have never sought, will not seek and do not want to be considered for vice-president.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Trump] will be best served by a running mate and by surrogates who fully embrace his campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While Republican voters have chosen Donald Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee, my previously stated reservations about his campaign and concerns with many of his policies remain unchanged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubio, who bowed out of the presidential race after being routed by Donald Trump in the Florida primary, said he was focused on his job in the Senate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anxiety over Donald Trump spread among congressional Republicans on Monday, pushing several to follow House Speaker Paul Ryan's lead and withhold their support from the divisive billionaire. Ryan himself declared there was no point in trying to &quot;fake&quot; party unity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we go forward pretending that we're unified, then we are going to be at half-strength this fall,&quot; Ryan told the Journal Times in Racine, Wisconsin, defending his decision to refuse to endorse his party's presumptive presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, in interviews with home-state reporters Monday, Ryan denounced the idea of any Republican launching a third-party or independent candidacy to challenge Trump, telling the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel it &quot;would be a disaster for our party&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan said he would step aside from the House Speaker's traditional role as chairman of the Republican National Convention if Trump wanted him to, a scenario that Trump has left open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the nominee. I'll do whatever he wants in respect to the convention,&quot; Ryan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments from Ryan and Trump came as both men prepared for a face-to-face meeting Thursday, which Republican leaders hope will begin to mend the fabric of their party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other Republicans have also sought to distance themselves from Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, one of the most endangered Senate Republicans, wrote an opinion piece in the Philadelphia Inquirer drawing back from his long-stated intent to back the GOP nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toomey said he was &quot;inclined to support the nominee&quot; of his party but wrote of Trump: &quot;His vulgarity, particularly toward women, is appalling. His lack of appreciation for constitutional limits on executive powers is deeply concerning... In short I find his candidacy highly problematic,&quot; Toomey wrote of Trump. &quot;There could come a point at which the differences are so great as to be irreconcilable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has shrugged off the need for unity heading into the November general election and a likely match-up against Democrat Hillary Clinton, even though that would be the goal in any normal election year after a candidate effectively clinches the nomination, as Trump has done. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this is a time for unity. And if there's not going to be unity, I think that's OK, too,&quot; Trump said on Fox Business Network. &quot;I mean, I'll go out and I think I'll do very well. I think I'm going to win the race either way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEXAS SEN. Ted Cruz called Donald Trump a creature of the &quot;fever swamps of the left&quot; Sunday, as Trump moved to explain his one-time support for impeaching President George W. Bush.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those are the views of the fever swamps of the left. That's where Donald comes from is the fever swamps of the left,&quot; Cruz said on ABC's &quot;This Week,&quot; amid an ongoing debate over Trump's comments in 2008 that it would have been &quot;wonderful&quot; to impeach Bush over the Iraq War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruz continued his South Carolina primary attack that Republican front-runner Trump is not conservative enough, claiming his Supreme Court nominees would be indistinguishable from those of Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Donald Trump becomes President, the Second Amendment will be written out of the Constitution because it is abundantly clear that Donald Trump is not a conservative,&quot; he said. &quot;And so the result would be the same whether it's Hillary, Bernie or Donald Trump. The Second Amendment will go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruz said the death of Justice Antonin Scalia &quot;really changes the entire contours of this race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time for the circus and the reality show is over,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump (below), also appearing on &quot;This Week,&quot; continued to attack the ex-President for launching the Iraq War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't even think about it. It's past time,&quot; he said of his impeachment call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He made a horrible mistake. We all make mistakes. His was a beauty. His was about as big a mistake as you can think of,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I'll tell you what, it was a horrible mistake. We spent $2 trillion on that war and we have nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Either for a majority of this year's voters turn out to be 60-plus years old, white, high-school-educated men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Republicans can massively suppress the vote in a half dozen key swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. He can pick up the support of disillusioned Bernie Sanders partisans, even though they disagree with him on abortion rights, the death penalty, gay marriage, global warming and immigration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What next after Trump's rally canceled?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Donald Trump campaign that for months seemed to grow stronger with every controversial statement was put on ice for at least one night by a raucous crowd of Chicago protesters that overwhelmed his planned rally and enraged many of his supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A line that wrapped around the University of Illinois Pavilion for hours before the event was largely peaceful as Trump supporters and detractors stood together without the reports of violence that have plagued his campaign in recent weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But inside the arena was much different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 30 minutes after the Republican presidential front-runner was scheduled to take the stage at 6 p.m., factions clashed through competing chants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, an announcer said Trump had arrived in Chicago, consulted with law enforcement officials and decided to cancel the rally because of safety concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that, the crowd erupted in bedlam with spectators flooding the arena floor. Clashes appeared to be mostly verbal, but some people were videorecorded throwing punches and shoving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you guys satisfied?&quot; one red-faced Trump supporter repeatedly yelled, jabbing his finger at TV news crews on risers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emily Jahn, of Grayslake, said she and her mother attended the event not to show support or opposition but just to see what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wouldn't have put it at a college campus in the middle of Chicago unless he wanted people to get mad,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it's what he wanted, to get attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens now for Trump and his primary race against Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich could play out over the coming days. Illinois' primary is Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews, Trump was defensive and argued that anger boiling over at his rallies had been building for years and was not spurred by his campaign alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a very divided country,&quot; Trump said. &quot;We have a country that's so divided that maybe even you don't understand it. I've never seen anything like it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruz, speaking Friday at the Northwest Suburban Republicans' Lincoln Day Dinner in Rolling Meadows, called the clash at UIC &quot;a sad day&quot; but suggested Trump's rhetoric was partly responsible. &quot;I hope going forward for a respectful, substantive, issue-based discussion,&quot; Cruz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump and all of the Republican candidates initially had been invited to the Rolling Meadows dinner, and after his Chicago rally was shut down Trump offered to make an appearance but was &quot;politely declined,&quot; a source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has run a campaign aimed at disrupting the political establishment, and many of the protesters Friday night were backers of the race's other anti-establishment candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of protesters inside the UIC Pavilion chanted &quot;Bernie, Bernie,&quot; who also had a rally Friday night in the suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's campaign issued a statement saying Trump had arrived in Chicago and &quot;after meeting with law enforcement has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight's rally will be postponed to another date. Thank you very much for your attendance and please go in peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chicago Police Department said it was informed shortly before 6:30 p.m. that the Trump campaign had canceled the event. Police were not consulted before the decision was made, according to spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Booker, chief of the University of Illinois at Chicago police, said no one was injured or arrested as the arena was emptied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the rally, protesters took to the streets where they were lined up behind barricades and faced by many police officers, including more than a dozen officers on horses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who won? We won,&quot; hundreds of protesters chanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barry Rush, a medical student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says he disagrees with Trump's rhetoric and hopes other cities will follow Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that other cities will follow and will show him that we're not going to stand for this kind of junk,&quot; Rush said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty-two people were arrested at a St. Louis rally earlier Friday, and reports of violence at recent Trump events dogged the candidate in Thursday night's debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People come with tremendous passion and love for the country,&quot; Trump said at Thursday's debate. &quot;When they see what's going on in this country, they have anger that's unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A white Trump supporter was charged with assault Thursday after video showed him hitting a black man being escorted out of the venue by sheriff's deputies at a campaign rally Wednesday in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump told MSNBC in a telephone interview after the Chicago cancellation: &quot;I just don't want to see people hurt. We can come back and do it another time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the election four days away, it was unclear what he meant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanders, who addressed a rally of his own Friday in Summit, expressed concern over the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope that we are not in a moment in American history where people are going to be intimidated and roughed up and frightened about going to a political rally ... . I hope Mr. Trump speaks out forcefully and tells his supporters that that is not what the American political process is about.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An online petition has surfaced that asks Bolingbrook Mayor Roger Claar to cancel the Sept. 19 fundraiser at the Bolingbrook Golf Club.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event, whose sponsors include Claar and former gubernatorial candidate and executive Ron Gidwitz, features a luncheon and VIP roundtable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tickets, ranging from $1,000 for a person to $250,000 for a couple, are available, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's been a big response given the ticket price,&quot; Claar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He originally supported Republican primary hopeful Jeb Bush, but when the former Florida governor's campaign imploded, Claar threw his backing behind Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While acknowledging some residents weren't thrilled about Trump's visit to Bolingbrook, &quot;I'm personally very happy about it,&quot; Claar said. &quot;It's great for us, it's great for the club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump faces Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 24--SOUTH ABINGTON TWP. -- When it comes to fulfilling campaign promises, if elected, Donald Trump would apply the same techniques he's used on the campaign trail, his firstborn son said at a campaign event Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's going to be a disrupter,&quot; Donald Trump Jr. said. &quot;And that's critical here because we need somebody who's going to disrupt things, because the same-old, same-old hasn't been working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump played up his years as a youth attending the Hill School boarding school in Pottstown, later University of Pennsylvania for college, and frequent hunting and fishing trips to the mountains of Pennsylvania, as he stumped on his father's behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was a boy, Mr. Trump watched his father work as a committed businessman. Having passed the family business to his son, the elder Mr. Trump wants to use his business acumen to restore financial success and stability to America, his son said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 people packed his father's campaign office along State Street. They chanted &quot;Trump&quot; as his Cadillac Escalade pulled into the parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump visited in advance of his father's appearance scheduled for 7 p.m. Monday -- one day before the primary election -- at Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza, Wilkes-Barre Twp.Tickets are required</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his side, U.S. representatives Lou Barletta, R-11, Hazleton, and Tom Marino, R-10, Lycoming Twp., pressed the crowd to mind the delegates they vote for Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania Republicans will send 71 delegates to the Republican National Convention in July. Of them, only 17 are bound to vote for their districts' popular candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trump campaign office is advising voters on which delegates have pledged to vote for the elder Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not a rubber-stamper. He's got convictions, and he lets people know what he stands for,&quot; said Robert Sukel of Waverly Twp., wearing a fire-engine-red cap emblazoned with the Trump slogan, &quot;Make America great again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching from the back of the campaign office, Bill and Susan Rice of Tunkhannock said they believe Mr. Trump would relieve big corporations of their political power and restore it to the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's going to change government,&quot; Mrs. Rice said. &quot;The way it's run now, the people don't have a say in anything and he's going to change all that, make it great again, make it our government again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election campaign in the United States has inspired horror among Republicans and among many Democrats too. The rise of the radical billionaire Donald Trump in the Republican race for the nomination of US President is a serious threat indeed. Trump is promising George W. Bush-style cuts (for the wealthy) as the key to prosperity. He seems to have learned nothing from past Republican president's disasters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the most odious, bullying, narcissistic tyrants in the world at the moment have been building their popularity by their 'fireworks' display in their various methods. Putin is having his way in the Middle East, killing opposition activists and their families to keep Assad in power while at the same time trying to destabilize Europe; the North Korean leader is fuelling his nuclear ambitions to try and destroy the world, and Donald Trump is gaining ground to get the nomination for President of the United States come November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Donald Trump and dictator Vladimir Putin have reached the peak of their absurdities by professing their mutual affection for each other. Russian President Vladimir Macchiavelli Putin is invading countries as he pleases, stifling dissidents and accused of killing those who oppose him! And comedian Donald Trump says that Vladimir Putin is 'worthy of admiration'! But Donald Trump also sneers at women, the disabled, blacks, Mexicans, Muslims, war veterans and anyone who is unattractive. Vladimir Macchiavelli Putin now says that Donald Trump is a really brilliant and talented person that is suitable to become President of the United States. So now we have this equation: the vulgar Trump and war criminal Putin. If the North Korean president joins them, we will have 'three coins in a fountain'...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another poll held this week in the US found that 50 per cent of American voters would be heavily embarrassed if Donald Trump is eventually nominated for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this age of the rude and crude, is there a glimmer of hope in this world or a tiny shred of decency?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR> &quot;Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan approvingly spoke at Donald Trump's convention, endorsed Donald Trump for president and believe he is mentally fit to sit in the Oval Office. Occasional statements that do nothing to repudiate Donald Trump's words and actions are spineless. Anything short of revoking their endorsements is cowardice.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> &quot;It took less than two days for Senator McConnell to call for then-Rep. Todd Akin to end his Senate campaign citing Akin's 'deeply offensive error at a time when his candidacy carries great consequence for the future of our country.' Donald Trump's candidacy carries even greater consequence, yet Senator McConnell remains silent.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR> &quot;This shouldn't be hard. Donald Trump is a sexist and racist man who insults Gold Star parents, stokes fear of Muslims and sows hatred of Latinos.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 07--HIGHLIGHTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(ASTERISK) -Donald Trump made 180 degree turn from father's work</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(ASTERISK) -Major buildings, outsized influence, plenty of controversy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's legacy in New York City is the stuff of myth: an outsized stamp on real estate characterized by a blend of self-aggrandizement and undeniable tenacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP front-runner's name is seemingly everywhere in the Big Apple, from Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue to Trump Place on the West Side; there's Trump World Tower near the United Nations, and the Trump International Hotel and Tower at the southwest corner of Central Park. That's not to mention Wollman Rink and the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point in the Bronx.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, Trump represents &quot;an ascension of ego, of surface, and of explicitly catering to new wealth,&quot; said Matthew Lasner, co-editor of &quot;Affordable Housing in New York,&quot; who dubbed The Donald &quot;the Gordon Gekko of developers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His real estate career largely parallels NYC's shift from a family friendly haven for the middle class into a gold-plated grotto for the world's wealthy, contends Thomas J. Campanella, city and regional planning professor at Cornell University and author of the upcoming book, &quot;Brooklyn: A Secret History.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Fred Trump, &quot;the Henry Ford of Housing,&quot; made his fortune building thousands of &quot;wonderful and very affordable&quot; homes for the working class throughout Queens and Brooklyn, &quot;The Donald&quot; opted to ply his father's craft by erecting luxury accommodations in Manhattan that appeal to the moneyed international jet set, Campanella said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very ironic,&quot; said Campanella, noting that the affordable homes built by the elder Trump and subsequently snapped up by blue collar and city workers &quot;were built to last. The quality of their construction was extraordinary compared to what is built today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike his father's sturdy, enduring, modest accommodations, Donald's buildings &quot;have not aged that well&quot; architecturally, said Campanella, describing them as distinctly &quot;late 80s,&quot; and painfully gaudy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Trump's successes throughout his local career demonstrate a real proficicency in what he has famously deemed &quot;the art of the deal,&quot; according to Tom Angotti, author of &quot;New York for Sale,&quot; and a professor of urban affairs and planning at the CUNY Graduate Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there are the civic efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1986, Trump offered to rebuild Wollman Rink in Central Park after the city suffered six years of setbacks and cost overruns. Last year, he opened the public golf club in the Bronx after a decade of struggles preceded him. Both locales charge significant fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trump presidential campaign did not respond to an emailed request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Lasner said he is not sentimental about what Trump's buildings replaced (&quot;all buildings look good for 10 years, terrible for 30 years and then they're historic&quot;) he noted that some of Trump's behavior as a developer &quot;represents a lack of public spiritedness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of giving the historic art deco friezes on the Fifth Avenue Bonwit building to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which wanted them for its sculpture garden, for example, Trump destroyed them to make way for Trump Tower. The Trump Organization contended that the two-ton panels were &quot;without artistic merit,&quot; and would cost $500,000 to save, according to a story in the New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Trump is just a &quot;footnote to the city's overall development,&quot; Lasner says, his bombast looms large. Almost from the time the 69-year-old joined his father's business in the late 1960s, Trump has been a major cultural presence in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has that New York attitude,&quot; notes Marco Mendez, 43, who lives in Trump's native Jamaica Estates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are the innocuous scenes: starring in commercials, making cameos in movies, dressing in drag with Rudy Giuliani for an Inner Circle roast, hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and launching &quot;The Apprentice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there are other moments that stand more controversially, most notably when he put out ads in the New York Daily News calling for the death penalty to be re-instituted for the &quot;Central Park Five&quot; teens falsely accused of the brutal rape of a jogger in April 1989.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Donald Trump on display Wednesday as would-be Immigration Enforcer-in-Chief was unlike any of the Donald Trumps we've seen this campaign. During a visit with Mexican President Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, Trump was cordial, respectful, soft-spoken and extremely guarded in his words.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's strong evidence that his new team of handlers have convinced Trump that his presidential prospects will continue to diminish unless his tone changes. That's good, provided he can keep it up. We worry that he can't, however, because of the speech the GOP candidate gave in Phoenix later Wednesday outlining the major tenets of his immigration enforcement plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech was full of the standard Trump brashness and unsupported, broad-sweep characterizations. Particularly disappointing was his failure (again) to explain the cost and financing of his immigration plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mexico City, Trump told reporters he and Pe&ntilde;a Nieto did not discuss the single most repeated and most outlandish tenet of Trump's plan: building a wall across the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. Trump continues to insist Mexico will pay for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the topic didn't come up in the Mexico meeting, the fault was all Trump's. Did he lose his nerve once he sat face-to-face with the Mexican president? Did he somehow forget to bring it up?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who pays for the wall? We didn't discuss,&quot; Trump told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pe&ntilde;a Nieto stated afterward that the issue did come up at the start of the meeting, and he &quot;made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Phoenix Wednesday night, Trump invoked it as his top priority. &quot;On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border. ... and Mexico will pay for the wall,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His obsession with this fantasy detracts from other aspects of Trump's immigration speech that actually are worthy of consideration. He correctly says, for example, that criminal aliens should be deported from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That also happens to be the top enforcement priority of the Obama administration. Since 2009, the United States has deported more than 2 million unauthorized immigrants, more than a third of whom held criminal status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump is correct that the E-Verify program should be expanded to ensure that U.S. employers don't profit by evading laws designed to reduce the magnet appeal of illegal employment here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His plan to expand biometric screening also is worth consideration. Paying for it - plus the wall, plus his proposed 5,000 extra border enforcers, plus extra prison facilities to house potential deportees, plus the extra personnel and vehicles required to hunt down and expel 11 million unauthorized immigrants - is the big question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching Hillary Clinton beaming sidewise onstage as Elizabeth Warren taunted Donald Trump brought the Wrigley twin ditty to mind:  Double your pleasure, double your fun, with double good, double good, Doublemint gum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of two happy twins riding a tandem bicycle to celebrate chewing gum, the Clinton-Warren sixties sister-clones - wearing blond bobs and shades of blue - rode Trump with a gobsmacking double punch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Railed the senator from Massachusetts: &quot;Now, Donald Trump says he'll make America great again. . . . It's stamped on the front of his goofy hat. You want to see goofy? Look at him in that hat.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was her way of topping Trump's repeated use of &quot;goofy&quot; to insult her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And: &quot;When Donald Trump says 'great,' I ask: 'Great for who, exactly?' &quot; she said. &quot;When Donald Trump says he'll make America great, he means make it even greater for rich guys just like Donald Trump. . . . That's who Donald Trump is. . . . And watch out, because he will crush you into the dirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so the Twitter wars between a non-candidate and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee will likely continue. Doesn't Trump realize that he's the one running for president? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's rally, the first to feature Warren, was followed by a sisterhood hug that only women can exchange. That simple embrace signified a new benchmark in women's and American history and changed the political narrative for all time. Not only can a woman win a major party's nomination, but also it's possible that two women can team up as running mates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that Warren might become Clinton's vice presidential pick  has been floating around for a while and is appealing if only for the prospect that two women could fill an entire presidential ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warren certainly is as qualified as many men who have filled the role. She obviously doesn't mind serving as the attack dog for Clinton. And Warren may be the one grinding Trump into the dirt, invective for invective. In a word, she's fearless to his careless. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warren and Clinton haven't always been so cozy, but, for the eternal record, women differ from one another in as many ways as men do. Warren is further to the left than Clinton ever meant to be. And she comes far more naturally to a populist message. While Clinton was being forced leftward by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Warren was continuing her years-long progressive crusade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her endorsement of Clinton and her new role as a rowdy, crowd-warming act constitute a bridge between Sanders supporters and the presumptive nominee they never wanted. Warren captures the anger and anti-1-percent angst of the liberal left and lays it like a wreath at the feet of the woman who would become the first female president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warren is a peace offering who aims to wage war on Trump. And she's on to his greatest weakness. He can't take a ribbing and he can't stand being challenged by a woman. It gets under his skin like nothing else. Thus, when Warren says he looks goofy in a hat, he calls her Pocahontas (for her having said she has Native American blood).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's clear is that Warren won't back down no matter what Trump tosses her way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking strictly as an observer, I think  Trump may be losing his ranking as top draw in the political circus. If Warren stays on the stage, it's nearly assured that all eyes will be on her - which might cause Clintonites some concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Trump, Warren has that certain something that fills arenas and draws people to their feet. That's where the similarities end. A Harvard law professor before she ran for the U.S. Senate, Warren is smart, eloquent on consumer protection issues and passionately committed to well-defined principles. One needn't agree with her to appreciate her vigor, as well as a steely-eyed softness that comes across in person. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Trump, she's in possession of an agreeable personality. Even when yelling across a surging crowd, she manages to avoid sounding strident. Close up, she's warm, engaging and nonthreatening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most important, she allows Clinton to step back from the fray and gives everyone a chance to imagine what a two-woman ticket could look like. Too much the same? Too soon for two? For whom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be true, as someone wrote me, that Clinton's greatest virtue is her opponent. But it's also plain that Warren is her greatest asset. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk about a twofer. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAVID DUKE says comparing Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler is YUGE for the Nazi dictator. &quot;They might be rehabilitating that fellow with the mustache back there in Germany, because I saw a commercial against Donald Trump, a really vicious commercial,&quot; the former Ku Klux Klan leader said on his radio program Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial, Duke said, compared &quot;what Donald Trump said about preserving America and making America great again to Hitler in Germany preserving Germany and making Germany great again and free again and not beholden to these Communists on one side, politically who were trying to destroy their land and their freedom, and the Jewish capitalists on the other, who were ripping off the nation through the banking system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duke told the Daily News it's ludicrous to compare Trump and Hitler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It actually lessens any negative image that people have. It makes Hitler seem certainly not as demonic,&quot; Duke said. &quot;It makes Hitler not the demon you say he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump last month disavowed any support from Duke, but not before catching heat over how long it took him to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know anything about David Duke,&quot; Trump said, before distancing himself from the hater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump's GOP presidential rival John Kasich ripped the front-runner Thursday over his suggestion earlier this week that voters would riot at the Republican National Convention this summer if he was blocked from being the nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody should say such things, in my opinion,&quot; Ryan said inside the Capitol. &quot;To even address or hint at violence is unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasich blasted the mogul in a series of tweets, calling Trump's remarks &quot;unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This implicit acceptance of violence is the kind of rhetoric that's pulling people apart,&quot; Kasich said. &quot;A true leader urges peaceful debate over violence. Leadership requires responsibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day earlier, Trump warned of &quot;riots&quot; and &quot;bad things&quot; if party leaders blocked him from getting the nomination despite having the most delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump was active on Twitter throughout the day, but did not address the Ryan and Kasich comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he focused on what he thinks is a bigger issue - his old foe Megyn Kelly. He lashed out at the Fox News Channel moderator as being &quot;crazy,&quot; this time for interviewing rival candidate Ted Cruz on her program Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lying Ted Cruz on her show last night,&quot; he tweeted. &quot;Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the hilarious question former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host Jon Stewart posed Monday on David Axelrod's podcast.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart made the remarks about presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics, where he and Axelrod taped &quot;The Axe Files.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't even know if Donald Trump is eligible to be president, and that's not a birther thing ... Are you eligible to run if you are a man-baby ... a baby-man?&quot; Stewart wondered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is a man-baby,&quot; he continued. &quot;He has the physical countenance of a man and a baby's temperament and hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart went on to call Trump thin-skinned, and he remarked that Vanity Fair's Graydon Carter joked about Trump's hands 25 years ago. &quot;He's still not [expletive] over it,&quot; Stewart said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When people ask me why I am supporting Donald Trump, I try to make my answer as simple as possible,&quot; Jasperse said Thursday night at a meeting of the Murray County Republican Party in Chatsworth. &quot;The courts are very important. In the Legislature, we can pass laws. But the courts can overturn those laws or reinterpret them in ways that we may not have intended. And I know that Donald Trump is much more likely to appoint conservative judges and Supreme Court justices than Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasperse represents District 11 in the state House of Representatives, which includes parts of Murray, Gordon and Pickens counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But several members of the audience pressed him on why a number of local elected officials who are Republican weren't at the Pence rally in Dalton on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dalton resident Larry Swanson, for instance, noted that members of the Whitfield County Board of Commissioners were not there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasperse said he could not speak for other Republicans but noted that several legislative committees were meeting in Atlanta and some members of the Legislature may have had official business that conflicted with the afternoon rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reached Friday, Whitfield County Board of Commissioners Mike Babb noted that the rally was announced on Friday, Aug. 26, which was relatively short notice. He said he had a conflicting meeting in LaFayette, where he and officials from several other neighboring counties received checks from the Association of County Commissioners of Georgia for good results in their worker's compensation programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My presence or absence at the rally won't make any difference in the presidential election, but I wanted to get that $24,000 check for the county,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Lynn Laughter said her schedule was also full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was announced on pretty short notice. I had clients booked all day,&quot; said Laughter, who is a financial adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at Thursday's Republican Party meeting some worried about the impact that Republican elected officials who don't seem to be supporting Trump could have on the November election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People need to understand this is a binary decision. If you don't vote for Trump, you are effectively voting for Hillary Clinton,&quot; said Ed Painter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasperse agreed with that point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know from experience. I voted for Ross Perot, so, in effect, I helped elect Bill Clinton, and I regret that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jasperse said he didn't believe Republican leaders in the state House of Representatives needed to lean on members to publicly support Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that's the job of people like the people in this room,&quot; he said. &quot;They elect us, and they need to tell us what it important to them and what they expect us to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasperse noted that Murray County is now a heavily Republican area and Trump handily won Murray County in the Republican presidential primary earlier this year with 57 percent of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he presented numbers showing that Murray County tends to lag the state as a whole significantly in turnout and urged party members to start knocking on doors urging people to vote to get that turnout up in November.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all started when Trump accused Cruz late Tuesday night of using his wife Melania's image from a GQ photo shoot in an anti-Trump ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruz fired back that his campaign wasn't behind the ad and called Trump a &quot;coward&quot; for trying to bring his wife Heidi into the fray.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Donald Trump speechwriter has admitted passages in a speech made by Melania Trump at the Republican Party convention were first made by Michelle Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meredith McIver said she took the blame amid allegations of plagiarism which have dogged the opening days of the convention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump's campaign strenuously denied the accusations for two days, describing them as &quot;absurd&quot;, before the admission emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the writer added Mrs Trump knew the passages were from the first lady's speech, which was delivered in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;A person she has always liked is Michelle Obama. Over the phone, she read me some passages from Mrs Obama's speech as examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms McIver, co-author of some of Donald Trump's books, offered her resignation over the controversy but it was rejected by the Republican presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, sharp-eyed viewers expressed outrage over the similarities between a speech made by Mrs Trump to one given by the first lady eight years previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passages in question came near the beginning of Mrs Trump's nearly 15-minute speech.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight years ago, Mrs Obama said: &quot;And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: like, you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, that you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar overlaps included how to convey to children that there is no limit to what they can achieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Trump's address was otherwise distinct from the speech that Mrs. Obama gave when her husband was being nominated for president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2,500 star-shaped tiles which line the street pay tribute to celebrities past and present.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what happens if the people walking all over the top of you don't like you?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents and visitors to Los Angeles have been posting photographs of his star to social media when they notice it has been defaced - and it's not very flattering for Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">donald trump tweet mute symbol</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far his star has had a 'mute' symbol and a swastika painted on it, as well as various swear words (which we're not going to republish), and had been showered in spit, urine and dog faeces.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DONALD TRUMP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too scary to imagine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want the American people to think that if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress, that's going to be a scary outcome.&quot; - Mitch McConnell, after the 2014 midterm elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, Donald Trump didn't get that message. He is by far the most frightening Republican candidate for president in the history of the party. Here are some of his more scary quotes:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why can't we use nuclear weapons?&quot; - Donald Trump, with a foreign policy adviser. He asked the question three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Vladimir Putin) is not going into Ukraine, OK, just so you understand. He's not gonna go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down.&quot; Trump made this statement despite the fact that Russia had already taken Crimea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've had a beautiful, I've had a flawless campaign.&quot; - Donald Trump, July 29, 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.&quot; - Donald Trump, calling on the Russians to hack U.S. government emails to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many other missteps attributed to Trump - too many to list here. He is an egocentric demagogue, and he only serves himself. I really don't care what his economic message is at this point. The only thing more scary than candidate Donald Trump would be President Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAVID HEWITT, Topeka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANIMAL CRUELTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We love 'em to death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's 10 highest grossing box office releases are about animals, including: &quot;Finding Dory,&quot; &quot;The Jungle Book,&quot; &quot;Zootopia,&quot; &quot;The Secret Life of Pets&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu Panda.&quot; Nearly half of our households include a dog, and nearly 40 percent have a cat. Two-thirds of us view them as family members and cherish them accordingly. We love our animals to death - literally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For every cat, dog or other animal that we love and cherish, we put 500 through months of caging, crowding, deprivation, mutilation and starvation - all before we take their lives, cut their dead bodies into little pieces and shove those into our mouths. And that doesn't even include Dory and billions of her little friends, because we haven't figured out how to count individual aquatic animals that we grind up for human or animal feed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that we have a choice every time we visit a restaurant or grocery store. We can choose live foods - yellow and green vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts and grains, as well as a rich variety of grain and nut-based meats and dairy products. Or we can choose dead animals - their body parts and other products of their abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will it be?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RICH WRAY, Topeka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUPREME COURT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check justices' records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the five Kansas Supreme Court justices who will be up for retention in the November election, Justice Caleb Stegall is the only one appointed to the court by Gov. Sam Brownback. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Brownback's notorious incompetence in essentially everything, it will be best to vote for Stegall's ouster. The other four justices - Beier, Biles, Luckert and Nuss - were all appointed by governors prior to Brownback. These four haven't shown evidence of being Brownback's puppets, which is to their credit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they used extremely faulty judgment in voting to overturn the capital murder sentences of Jonathan and Reginald Carr, who committed multiple heinous murders in the Wichita area in 2000. Both of the Carrs deserve to be poster children for why Kansas should have and carry out the death sentence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The votes of these four justices about the Carrs are clear marks against their being retained. Voters need to weigh the pros and cons carefully when voting on retention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the beginning, the Republican establishment denied that a Donald Trump candidacy could possibly be viable. It had to be some kind of joke. Then came palpable anger as Trump dominated debates and began sweeping primary after primary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some establishment figures, such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, decided that the only way to deal with the Trump phenomenon was to bargain with him - as if Donald Trump were someone that a reasonable person could work with. Then, when the establishment realized it was far too late to deny Trump the 1,237 delegates he needed to lock up the Republican nomination, there was mass depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denial, anger, bargaining, depression. Now comes the last of Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross' five stages of grief: acceptance. Trump is almost certainly going to be the Republican Party's presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite what many readers think, this newspaper is not anti-Republican. We like good ideas wherever they come from. Our problem with Trump is that he has yet to offer a single well-honed good idea. He's thrown out some interesting concepts, but they've been swamped by unworkable solutions and racist, sexist vitriol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party of Lincoln should be grieving over the triumph of Trump, which was largely sealed by his overwhelming victory in Indiana's primary on Tuesday. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz quickly withdrew and was soon followed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Nothing stands in the way of Trump's freight train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had Republicans opted for Kasich, who dreams of a contested GOP convention in July, Americans would have had a fair choice between his conservative record and the ideas of the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Trump has no record, and his ideas are a mystery mishmash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump is the most unpopular presidential candidate posted by either party in the past three decades, according to data compiled by The Washington Post, a fact that only works for Clinton. But as 16 former GOP candidates can attest, only a fool would dismiss the seriousness of a Trump presidential bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party leaders still don't know how to react. They can methodically deny him access to the funds he needs to keep his campaign afloat, turning attention instead to down-ballot races, hoping that Trump doesn't take GOP congressional candidates down with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third-party candidacy could develop in hopes of splitting the vote and denying Trump any chance at victory. This would hand the presidency to the Democrats, which many conservatives regard as unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which leaves the party with another option: Get behind this candidate, something many prominent Republicans say they will never do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing is certain: A big part of the GOP base has spoken loudly and clearly. These voters demand a shake-up of the establishment. And for better or worse, the establishment is badly shaken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I admired the community worker's optimism - I just hope he is right. In The Mad World Of Donald Trump (Channel 4, Tuesday) , he told us: &quot;Donald Trump is appealing to fear and anger but not to hope. It's very scary, but I've got a lot of faith and confidence that America is better than Donald Trump.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us pray that it is, or else a man whose views are far more dangerous than his hairstyle is idiotic could soon become one of the most powerful individuals on the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the Republican establishment is alarmed that he has become the party's poster boy and favourite to land its nomination in the race to be the next US President. One strategist dismissed him as a huckster and a fraud, saying it would be an &quot;utter stark raving disaster&quot; for the Republican party if he was successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a reality show,&quot; he declared - though, sadly, the mad bloke with the big mouth is the one appealing to many viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who are these people? Pollsters say the wealth-flaunting Trump's typical supporters are relatively poorly-educated white males. We saw a lot of them - and many women, too - at his campaign rallies, and footage of supporters turning, mob like, on protestors, including Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jibril told presenter Matt Frei what was at stake, while pointing out how people could become distracted by the pitiful excuse for a politician: &quot;In many ways he is a buffoon, but he is a buffoon who has to be taken seriously - he is close to getting the Republican nomination and close to becoming the American President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frei pointed out that the buzz phrases of Barack Obama 's campaigning were &quot;Hope and change&quot; and &quot;Yes we can&quot; - while one of Trump's is &quot;We are going to build a wall&quot; (along the US-Mexico border). He added that, during a 90 minute rally, Trump &quot;leapfrogged from one half-baked idea to another - and yet they love it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump appears to have serious issues - including many with women. We heard from Selina Scott , whose TV profile of him upset his ego so much that he sent her about a dozen &quot;extremely abusive&quot; letters. Selina fired one back: &quot;I said if you don't stop stalking me mentally I'm going to do you.&quot; Let's hope the Americans &quot;do&quot; Trump - by stopping him from becoming President.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign manager of US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton says Republican candidate Donald Trump &quot;could be puppet for the Kremlin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robby Mook made the remarks on Sunday in an interview with ABC News, days after the Clinton campaign released a video, raising questions about Trump's alleged close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's clear that they are supporting Donald Trump. But we now need Donald Trump to explain to us the extent to which the hand of the Kremlin is at the core of his own campaign,&quot; Mook said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then urged Trump to disclose his financial ties to the Russians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a web of financial interests that have not been disclosed, and there are real questions being raised about whether Donald Trump himself is just a puppet for the Kremlin in this race,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're saying Donald Trump is a puppet for the Kremlin?&quot; the bewildered ABC host asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mook replied by enlisting alleged connections between the Republican presidential nominee and the Russian president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've seen, over the last few weeks, him parroting Vladimir Putin in his own remarks,&quot; Mook said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We saw the Republican Party platform change. We saw Donald Trump talk about leaving NATO and leaving our Eastern European allies vulnerable to a Russian attack,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats have long accused the Kremlin of attempting to influence the US elections in favor of Trump, who has firmly denied any ties to Russia and its president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton campaign video, released earlier this month, began with an onscreen text that read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know why Trump praises Putin,&quot; before showing footage of the New York businessman describing the Russian head of state as a &quot;strong leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an article published by the New York Times on August 5, a former top CIA official accused Putin of recruiting Trump as an &quot;unwitting agent&quot; of Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former CIA acting director Michael Morell endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for president and called Trump unqualified and a threat to America's national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morell, who worked under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said he had voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past, but decided to end his silence over his political preferences because he considered Trump as a threat to national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trump's vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated,&quot; Morell wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the former secretary of state would keep &quot;our nation safe,&quot; and that she found her to be &quot;prepared, detail-oriented ad thoughtful&quot; when working with her in the past.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh, Aug. 6 -- Donald Trump's bullying tactics that he had used to great effect to take the Republican nomination against a pack of 16 others despite the Party being opposed to him has finally hit a dead end. Hillary Clinton has already widened her gap with the Republican candidate by double digits. Hillary Clinton has 49 per cent against Donald Trump's 39 per cent in the latest Fox news polls with many other polls showing bigger gaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party could have spared itself from getting seriously worried about Hillary Clinton's lead even though it is more than its comfort zone because, with nearly 100 days left until the election, time is not against it to catch up. Normally, both political parties gain a few percentage points after their respective Conventions. The Republican Party could have explained to itself Hillary Clinton's good showing in the polls as the outcome of the Democratic Party's successful Convention and move ahead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the widening gap is not the major worry of the Republican Party. Donald Trump has finally landed himself and the Party into a black hole that many, even some in the Republican Party itself, had expected all along. But, the Party bullied by the candidate did not dare to confront him earlier to stop him from winning the ticket. Donald Trump did not just bully his way to the top of the Republican Party, on the way he insulted some of the crucial groups that would decide the fate of the election, as for instance, the Hispanics/Latin voters and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party leadership did not confront Donald Trump because it had hoped that once he became the nominee, he would sober down and reach out beyond his narrow base of extreme right and white blue-collar workers towards the national constituencies. The leadership had also hoped that he would extend his hand to the Party after becoming the candidate as they thought it inconceivable that a candidate could hope to win a presidential election by insulting and bullying his own Party leaders and telling them to submit to him or to get lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party in dismay found that their hopes were totally misplaced because Donald Trump is more than a bully. They also realised what President Obama had pointed out in his speech at the Democratic Convention - that Donald Trump is neither a Republican nor a conservative. Perhaps the Party could still have found some ways to adjust with Donald Trump had he not picked the feud with the Gold Star parents Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala Khan whose son Captain Humayun Khan was killed in Iraq in 2004 and the way he handled it thereafter. (Parents who have lost a son/daughter fighting for the USA are proudly referred to a Gold Star parents).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khizr Khan had in his powerful statement at the Democratic Convention said certain things about Donald Trump that he should not have. He questioned Donald Trump's sacrifice for his country and also further questioned if he had read the Constitution. But for someone seeking the highest political office who had insulted everyone or every group he wanted or felt would be helpful for his objectives, Donald Trump did not show the minimum of tolerance. He also did not show decency by the way he insulted Khizr Khan's wife. He also failed to realise the consequences of insulting individuals proudly respected by all Americans on a bipartisan basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead as he has done ever since he entered the race, Donald Trump chose to bully and insult the Gold Star parents instead of giving himself some time to respond to Khizr Khan's accusations. If he had done that without the insults, he may even have scored some points. But Khizr Khan had touched Donald Trump's narcissist character and humungous ego and exposed the worst in his character, his knack for insulting people at will over which he has no control. In the process, he also exposed his utter lack of temperament to lead the country together with his bullying nature and cruel and insulting ways towards Gold Star parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feud shocked the nation and angered his own party leaders whom he had already bullied and insulted beyond limits. Thus not one of these leaders uttered one word to defend him. Many were openly critical of him and ashamed of what he had done. Sally Bradshaw, a leading Republican from Florida, in disgust left the Party. The reasons she gave for her decision were significant because in these she has articulated the dangers for America in electing Donald Trump. She said that the Republican Party is &quot; at a crossroads and have nominated a total narcissist -- a misogynist -- a bigot.&quot; She further added: &quot;This is a time when country has to take priority over political parties. Donald Trump cannot be elected president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is obvious to almost everyone in the country that Donald Trump has hit political dynamite with the Khans - to everyone except Donald Trump and his inner circle, of course. When it required calm and intelligent response for managing the devastating consequences, his campaign team went to ABC's George Stephanopoulos for damage control. That was like sending the lamb to the slaughterhouse. George Stephanopoulos, once a top aide of President Bill Clinton, clinically destroyed Donald Trump, the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Stephanopoulos encouraged Donald Trump to equate his building buildings and creating jobs to Gazala Khan's sacrificing her son for the service of the nation. He trapped Donald Trump to insult Gazala Khan more, describing her as someone dumb who has no views. And George Stephanopoulos finally led Donald Trump up the garden path into foreign affairs where he exposed him as one who did not even know that the Russians had invaded Ukraine in 2014 and had annexed Crimea!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The post-Khizr Khan-Donald Trump feud has brought American voters face-to-face with the question whether they could have some one as President with such lack of temperament and other negative character traits with the Football and the Biscuit. The Football is the code name for the 45-pound briefcase that contains the country's nuclear codes that remain by the side of the President 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year and one the outgoing President carries to the inaugural of the new President to hand it over to him/her. The Biscuit is code name for the personal identifier that allows the President to open the Football and launch USA's nuclear weapons either to defend the country or as offensive weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of a nuclear attack on the United States, the President's reaction time is six (6) minutes if the attack came from the land of its known nuclear enemies and three (3) minutes, if the attacks were launched from submarines. In using USA's humungous arsenal of nuclear weapons, its fate and with it, the world's, is inexplicably placed in the hands of its President. He alone is empowered to decide to launch US' nuclear weapons because in the three and six minutes he has for response, he has no way to consult anyone else! On his campaign trail, Donald Trump has questioned why the US keeps its nuclear arsenal if it does not use them and has urged Japan and South Korea to go nuclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans are thus deeply worried about Donald Trump becoming President because of serious doubts about his temperament. His own Party leaders more than others are now exploring ways to replace him. Meanwhile, as polls show the gap between him and Hillary Clinton widening, Donald Trump is totally oblivious of it as he is of the dangerous and developing consequences of his feud with Khizr Khan and his wife. Instead, he has asked his supporters not to believe in the polls because he is leading Hillary Clinton by substantial numbers and that the Party has never been so united as it is now - the claims that are raising questions in many minds if he is &quot;plain crazy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if he has sensed his future in the polls, Donald Trump has asked his supporters in a recent rally to be prepared for massive vote rigging against him. This raving only enhanced the concern in the country over the prospects of the Football and the Biscuit being in the possession of such a person if he ever became the President.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many delegates at both the Republican and Democratic conventions expressed dissatisfaction with their parties' presidential nominees, and that discord could have an effect on Illinois' 2018 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters upset with the choice between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could turn to Libertarian Gary Johnson or the Green Party's Jill Stein for president on their Illinois ballots. And if either -- or both -- gets more than 5 percent of the vote, it'll be much easier for those parties to get a candidate for governor on the 2018 ballot.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because crossing the 5 percent threshold in Illinois means a party's statewide contenders would only need 5,000 petition signatures to get on the ballot instead of 25,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten years ago, Green Party candidate for governor Rich Whitney got nearly 10 percent of the vote, making it easier for his party to get ballot access, at least temporarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaining exposure:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois' Libertarian Party chairman Lex Green said meeting that 5 percent threshold this time is a clear priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donors and media do not want to talk to us until after we've gotten ballot access,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it's too early to say how much of a role third-party candidates would play in the 2018 election. In 2014, Chad Grimm, the Libertarian candidate for governor, got a little more than 3 percent of the vote. The Green Party candidate got kicked off the ballot before Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another lawmaker gone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While former state Rep. Ron Sandack's abrupt resignation from the Illinois House this week was a surprising move by the Downers Grove Republican, his departure put him on a substantial bipartisan list of suburban lawmakers who won't be in Springfield for the second half of Gov. Bruce Rauner's term -- and there hasn't even been an election yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, Democratic state Rep. Jack Franks of Marengo said he wouldn't run for re-election, seeking the McHenry County Board chairmanship instead. Republican Sen. Dan Duffy of Lake Barrington and Democratic Sen. Dan Kotowski of Park Ridge both left earlier this year for new jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic state Sen. Mike Noland of Elgin ran for Congress. And Republican state Reps. Ed Sullivan of Mundelein and Mike Tryon of Crystal Lake both declined to run for re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are departures downstate, too, and incumbent losses in November would add to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's new is old:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions about whether U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin would run for governor in 2018 bubbled up at the Democratic Party convention this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a question about where I can best spend my life. Where can I achieve the goals that I want in public life? If I can do it in Washington and I feel I can be more effective there, of course that's where I'll stay,&quot; Durbin told the Daily Herald about a potential run for governor -- back in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would go on to win re-election in 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I won't make the final decision for some time now,&quot; he said at the 2000 convention in comments that reflect what he's said this week. &quot;I want to focus on this election campaign first.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Democrats have two words they want voters to remember this fall: Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While extolling the virtues of Democrats' House candidates across the country, the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) says Trump could fatally wound the chances of GOP incumbents and challengers down ticket.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the American people understand who Donald Trump is, and if they've been upset or hurt or disappointed by anything that Donald Trump has said, if they find that lots of other people have been saying those same things, I think that will matter to the American people,&quot; said DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M. &quot;So if we can tie Donald Trump to the Republicans and tie the Republicans to Donald Trump, that'll be a good night for Democrats in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DCCC is backing Doug Owens, who lost to Love by five points in 2014, with money and resources as they mount a rematch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a round-table discussion with reporters, Lujan touted Owens campaign as a great example this cycle of a Democrat who can take back a Republican seat. Owens is part of the DCCC's &quot;Red to Blue&quot; program..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many Republicans in Congress, Love has said she won't answer the question of whether she would vote for Trump if he was the Republican nominee. But her campaign says having Hillary Clinton as the head of the Democratic ticket could hurt Owens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the DCCC's candidate is promoting himself and unable to take a stance on any important issue, Mia is promoting Utah,&quot; said Dave Hansen, Love's campaign manager. &quot;Mia always shows up and fights for Utah values. The DCCC should be more concerned about Hillary Clinton being at the top of the ticket and the fact that Utah doesn't trust or want the likely Democrat nominee who, unfortunately, Owens sent money to and supported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owens gave $500 to Clinton in 2007 as she geared up for her first run at the White House, election records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DCCC counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, has said it doesn't need to pour resources into helping Love this time around as she's got a solid campaign on her own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lujan says Democrats are on the &quot;offense&quot; this cycle and hope to pick up enough seats to take back the majority in the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would take an immense wave of support for Democratic candidates. Republicans now hold 246 seats to Democrats' 188, the largest GOP majority in the chamber since the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 13--SHARONVILLE -- Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has created &quot;a toxic environment&quot; in American politics, which is now spilling over with violence at Trump's own political rallies, Gov. John Kasich told reporters before a Saturday morning speech in Sharonville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump has created a toxic environment,&quot; Kasich said. That &quot;toxic environment has allowed his supporters and those who sometimes seek confrontation to come together in violence. There is no place for this. There is no place for a national leader to prey on the fears of people who live in our great country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that we recognize their frustrations,&quot; Kasich said. &quot;It is important to recognize that there are challenges that we face -- challenges of job insecurity and a lack of rising wages, and a frustration that their children may not inherit the kind of life that they inherited from their parents. That is to be recognized. But it isn't to be used to drive people down -- it isn't used to divide people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If our rhetoric is negative, if our rhetoric is divisive, we will not solve these problems that the American people expect us to fix,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump apparently still has the governor's support if he becomes the party's nominee, although, &quot;It makes it extremely difficult,&quot; Kasich said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasich, at times angry and defiant, expressed disappointment with media coverage of the presidential campaign, and predicted that against uphill odds he will be the GOP nominee for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I would say to you is we'll see where this whole thing goes,&quot; Kasich said, when asked a second time if he would support Trump. &quot;I'm going to be the Republican nominee. I'm going to win Ohio, and do not be surprised if I go to the convention with the largest number of delegates. We have a thousand delegates yet to pick -- so don't be thinkin' that it isn't possible for me not to go there with great strength. Because it can happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other candidates finally are seeing the wisdom of taking the positive approach, Kasich said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm pleased to see that the other candidates in the last debate began to realize that name-calling, that lowering the bar on American politics is not acceptable,&quot; Kasich said. &quot;And I believe they have learned, at least in the last debate, that ideas matter, that vision matters, that policies matter, and giving people hope matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frankly, the coverage of this campaign has been disappointing,&quot; Kasich said. &quot;Because it seems as though the attention goes to those who call names. I refused to do it this entire campaign. Even if it meant that I would be ignored, even if it meant that I would lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day earlier, the other two GOP opponents of Trump had spoken out against violence at his rallies, while Kasich was silent when asked about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just to see Americans slugging themselves at a political rally deeply disturbed me. We're better than that. We're a nation that overcomes obstacles and challenges,&quot; Kasich said Saturday. &quot;I'm just reminded of when we worked together, in light of some terrible, terrible situations in Ohio, where we brought police and community together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave two reasons for his silence on Friday: First, he doesn't watch much TV news, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also: &quot;You don't get down in the mud and wrestle. You have a broader vision,&quot; Kasich said. &quot;Now, yesterday, when they asked me about the violence, I didn't know what you were talking about, because I didn't see it. But I saw it last night, and put a statement up last night, and I'm sort of to the point where I've had enough of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest day in Kasich's campaign will be Tuesday, when Ohioans turn out for the GOP primary. He announced in late February that if he doesn't win his home state he will drop out of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just up Interstate 75 from where Kasich gave his remarks at the Sharonville Convention Center, Trump a day later was to speak at 2 p.m. Sunday at The Savannah Center, at 5533 Chappell Crossing Blvd., in West Chester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a brash anti-Kasich ad Trump's campaign unveiled on Friday, the billionaire businessman and reality television star blasts Kasich as a senior executive at Lehman Brothers, whose 2008 collapse helped spark the financial crisis that led to the Great Recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's communications director, Alex Conant, said on CNN's This Hour program that Rubio supporters should vote for Kasich in Ohio, to prevent Trump from taking all Ohio's 66 delegates. That statement came with the insinuation that Kasich voters should support Rubio in Florida, in an attempt to gain a brokered political convention in Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasich has rejected the idea of asking his voters to support Rubio in Florida in an attempt to gain a brokered convention, where delegates would be free to vote for other candidates after the first ballot, if Trump would fail to gain the required 1,237 delegates on the first vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cincinnati, Donald Trump spoke for about 17 minutes and said his slogan for rebuilding the military will be &quot;Peace through strength.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Hillary Clinton leads in most polls, Donald Trump has a 10-point lead over Clinton among military households, according to a recent poll.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump told American Legion members he would pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CINCINNATI - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pledged to rebuild the American military, pursue a &quot;state of the art&quot; missile defense system and protect the country's borders during a speech at the American Legion's National Convention in Cincinnati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want to let anyone in our country who doesn't support our values and who is not capable of loving our people,&quot; Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was one of two Ohio appearances Thursday, which also included an afternoon rally in Wilmington where he focused on jobs and trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to stop the foreign cheating. The era of economic surrender, which is what we have done essentially, is over. A new era of American greatness is going to begin,&quot; Trump said in Wilmington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visits came a day after Trump's Arizona speech on immigration and a visit in Mexico with President Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, which Trump referenced in both speeches. It also followed a Wednesday speech by Hillary Clinton to the same veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump said of his visit with the Mexican president: &quot;We agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they also talked about &quot;the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings and a better market for products made in the United States,&quot; Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wilmington, Trump repeated his pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico but made no mention of reports that Pe&ntilde;a Nieto explicitly said Mexico will not pay for the wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico is going to pay for the wall,&quot; Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to stop drugs from coming in. We have got to stop the drugs from pouring into our states. It's poisoning our youth and others,&quot; Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of supporters in Wilmington chanted &quot;Build That Wall&quot; and &quot;USA&quot; as he delivered a 25-minute stump speech full of campaign promises, including plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, deliver a massive tax cut, create jobs and renegotiate unfair trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No state has been hurt worse, really, by Hillary Clinton on trade policy than Ohio,&quot; Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Clinton, his Democratic opponent, supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, China's entry into the World Trade Organization and the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton campaign said she opposes the TPP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilmington took a gut punch in 2008 when DHL pulled out of the Wilmington Air Park, costing 8,000 jobs. The county unemployment rate climbed above 16 percent, but by July had dropped to 5.7 percent as the air park site has been redeveloped and Wilmington-based Air Transport Services Group began flying cargo for retailer Amazon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ann Reno, executive chair of the Clinton County Democratic Party, responded to Trump's remarks by saying the county's families know what it is like to weather hard times and bounce back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The choice in this election is clear: Trump's reckless plans would cost millions of jobs and devastate the economy,&quot; Reno said. &quot;Hillary Clinton would build an economy that works for everyone - not just those at the top. Trump's empty rhetoric and irresponsible ideas are not welcome here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cincinnati, Trump spoke for about 17 minutes and said his slogan for rebuilding the military will be, &quot;Peace through strength.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America,&quot; Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He focused mostly on military and veterans issues and was met with frequent applause as he promised to reform the Veterans Administration, battle the Islamic State and stop Syrian refugees from coming to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump said Clinton supports increasing the number of Syrian refugees allowed into the United States, and he also criticized her deletion of personal emails from a private server she used for government email when she was secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton campaign issued a statement that &quot;despite his occasional lip service on the trail, Trump continually has disrespected our veterans and our military for decades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton has a detailed plan to ensure veterans have the &quot;opportunity, care and support they earned by serving our country,&quot; Harrell Kirstein, Clinton campaign Ohio spokesman, said in the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She will continue to support the needs of all who serve and will continue to put veterans first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither candidate has ever served in the military. Trump, 70, received multiple education deferments and eventually got a medical deferment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Clinton leads in most national polls, Trump has a 10-point lead over Clinton among military households, according to a recent poll from NBC News/SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This support comes even though he criticized the war record of U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and attacked a Gold Star family who spoke out against him during the Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough with all the Donald Trump and Rob Ford comparisons, says Jimmy Kimmel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talk show host was in Montreal this past week for the Just for Laughs comedy festival and to be a judge on JeffRoss Presents Roast Battle (available for streaming at thecomedynetwork. ca).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a few other comedians, he drew the line at comparing the Republican presidential candidate to the late Toronto mayor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Canadians like to say that,&quot; says Kimmel, &quot;but let's not forget that Rob Ford was smoking crack. When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been &quot;a gift from the comedy gods.&quot; He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He does two crazy things every day,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he knew who I was,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was impressive, says Kimmel. &quot;I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he &quot;immediately fell deeply in love&quot; with Montreal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). &quot;We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,&quot; he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, &quot;played a lot of tennis back in his day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get &quot;too inside&quot; by assuming that the audience has seen your show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting offon the wrong foot.&quot; !@COPYRIGHT=&copy; 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc. All rights reserved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greatest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few have lived who can truly lay claim to that title. Boxing legend Muhammad Ali, who died last week, was one of them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He faced many fights -- both inside and outside of the ring -- and he emerged as a champion time and time again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was willing to take a stand for his beliefs, regardless of the costs to his career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a force unto himself, a man who passionately fought against inequality. He will be missed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump accused U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of being biased against him due to Curiel's Mexican heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump is being sued over claims his former university was a scam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curiel was born in Indiana to parents who immigrated from Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump claims his stance on building a wall on the U.S. and Mexico border is causing Curiel to be biased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That claim is absurd. There is no proof that any of Curiel's decisions have been based on race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His parents came to the U.S. legally and he was born a U.S. citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the son of legal immigrants can't be unbiased, who can?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost every American is the descendent of an immigrant. All that varies is how far back their ancestors came to this nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has every right to contest this lawsuit in court. And he has every right to criticize the judge presiding over his case. But the way he has chosen to do so again shows how unfit he is for the presidency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 02--Donald Trump continues to display his inability to keep quiet when criticized and has opened an unwinnable debate with the Muslim American parents of an Army soldier killed in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khizr and Ghazala Khan appeared at the Democratic National Convention, where Mr. Khan called on Republican leaders to reject Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration and called it &quot;unconstitutional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, 27, was killed by a car bomber in 2004 in Iraq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump is now rightfully drawing criticism from multiple sources and both sides of the political aisle for his disparaging comments about this Gold Star family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, Monday in a written statement strongly condemned Trump's statement about the Khan family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In recent days, Donald Trump disparaged a fallen soldier's parents,&quot; said McCain. &quot;He suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States--to say nothing of entering its service. I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump's statement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, a respected politician on national security within the Republican Party and a former prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, is not the only one to criticize Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the Veterans of Foreign Wars condemned Trump and a group of Gold Star families of fallen service members called on Trump to apologize for his Khan comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Election year or not, the VFW will not tolerate anyone berating a Gold Star family member for exercising his or her right of speech or expression,&quot; said Brian Duffy, VFW president. &quot;Giving one's life to a nation is the greatest sacrifice, followed closely by all Gold Star families, who have a right to make their voices heard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter published Monday on VoteVets.org, a group of 11 &quot;Gold Star&quot; families wrote, &quot;Your recent comments regarding the khan family were repugnant and personally offensive to us. We ... demand you apologize to the Khans, to all Gold Star families, and to all Americans for your offensive, and frankly anti-American comments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said in a statement: &quot;There used to be some things that were sacred in American politics--that you don't do--like criticizing the parents of a fallen soldier even if they criticize you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweeted, &quot;This is so incredibly disrespectful of a family that endured the ultimate sacrifice for our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House rebuked Trump's statements, saying that Gold Star families deserve &quot;honor and gratitude&quot; for their family member's sacrifice. On Monday, President Obama told a veterans group that Gold Star families &quot;have made a sacrifice that most of us can't even begin to imagine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The swift condemnation of Trump's comments about the Khans by multiple individuals and groups means this controversy may not go away anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With fewer than 100 days remaining to Election Day, this controversy will increase pressure upon Republican leaders and candidates to determine whether they will continue to support the GOP nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, a former Republican nominee for president, wrote Monday in a statement &quot;... To Mr. and Mrs. Khan: thank you for immigrating to America. We're a better country because of you. And you are certainly right; your son was the best of America, and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation--and he will not be forgotten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kudos to McCain and others for standing up for respect and loyalty to our service men and women and against hatred and bigotry in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump could and should learn a lesson from the example of McCain and others. The sooner he learns this lesson, the better off America will be.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 08--Enthusiasm for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was lukewarm at the 1st District GOP Committee's convention Saturday in Fredericksburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers at the meeting in James Monroe High School's auditorium focused more on defeating Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton than they did on Trump. Trump was rarely mentioned by name, though U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st District, did take a line from the rich businessman when he said, &quot;We can make this nation great again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the more than 200 1st District Republicans in attendance elected three national delegates who unabashedly backed the presidential candidacy of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who suspended his campaign last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stafford County resident Steve Albertson, Spotsylvania County resident Laurie Tryfiates and Prince William County Supervisor Jeanine Lawson won the delegate slots for the national convention, which will be held July 18-21 in Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the three, only Lawson mentioned Trump by name during her remarks to attendees. &quot;Folks, Donald Trump is right--we have to make America great again,&quot; she said, adding that &quot;it is imperative that we unify because Hillary Clinton is an unacceptable choice for our nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, unsuccessful delegate candidate Adam Washington of Stafford received moderate applause after asking the audience, &quot;So who's ready to stump for Trump and make America great again?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albertson said he thinks it will take time for some Cruz supporters to get behind Trump, though he added, &quot;I do think we'll come around.&quot; He said many Republicans are committed to what he called &quot;well-defined principles&quot; but &quot;have some doubt about Trump being the standard-bearer&quot; for those beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tryfiates, who wore a button reading &quot;I'm a pro-life Republican,&quot; said &quot;there are a few positive signs that are happening in the Trump campaign&quot; such as his hiring of a conservative policy director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think a lot of conservatives are looking to see more from the presumptive nominee,&quot; she said, calling Cruz a &quot;proven conservative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruz out-organized Trump in recruiting delegates, drawing the ire of many of the rich businessman's supporters. But the Cruz loyalists probably won't play a factor at the national convention now that Trump is expected to clinch the nomination on the first ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notables at the 1st District convention included former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore--who unsuccessfully sought the GOP presidential nomination--state Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania and House Speaker Bill Howell, R-Stafford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Very few of the attendees sported Trump paraphernalia. Many wore orange &quot;guns save lives&quot; stickers that were distributed by the Virginia Citizens Defense League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some former Republican presidential candidates, including Jeb Bush, have said they will not vote for Trump or Clinton. Gilmore received applause at the 1st District convention after calling that sentiment &quot;entirely disloyal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince William Supervisor Corey Stewart, the chairman of Trump's campaign in Virginia, told audience members that he knows a lot of them were disappointed by Cruz's loss. But he said four years of Clinton appointing Supreme Court justices is &quot;something a Republican cannot tolerate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called the Democratic Party a &quot;big corrupt disgusting mass that is about to unravel at a very quick pace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we can do that together if we stay together,&quot; Stewart said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US presidential candidate was bathed in blue light and surrounded by a smokescreen as he arrived on stage to the 1977 hit in Cleveland, Ohio to kick start the four day event.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are frustrated by the repeated unauthorised use of the song after a previous request to desist, which has obviously been ignored by Mr. Trump and his campaign,&quot; the band said in a statement issued by their publishing company, Sony/ATV Music Publishing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Queen does not want its music associated with any mainstream or political debate in any country. Nor does Queen want 'We are the Champions' to be used as an endorsement of Mr. Trump and the political views of the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We trust, hope and expect that Mr. Trump and his campaign will respect these wishes moving forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on Facebook Newsom said: &quot;I'm not sure what Freddie Mercury would think of his music being played at the RNC convention, but I do know that if he weren't a famous rockstar, he would have probably been greeted by a wall, a really high wall, because he represented everything that Mike Pence and Donald Trump are scared of.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For hours, supporters and protesters lined Jefferson Avenue, wrapping around Olive Street and again to Madison Avenue waiting for the chance to see and hear the Republican presidential nominee who arrived around 3:40 p.m. Mr. Trump stepped out of a black SUV parked in Moir Court and waved to a group of around 100 supporters and protesters gathered on Vine Street.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing in line for the event, he was hard to miss, decked out in his American-flag-themed socks, shorts, T-shirt and bandana. He even used a flag as a makeshift cape and pinned it closed with a &quot;Donald Trump for President 2016&quot; button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's just like everybody else,&quot; he said. &quot;He's not politically correct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the block, protestors of all creeds gathered on the corner of Vine Street and Jefferson Avenue passionately but not violently clashing with supporters when the doors to the event closed around 3:10 p.m.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stood outside the rally holding up a sign that read, &quot;Senator McCain is a War Hero&quot; on one side and &quot;Donald spent Vietnam fighting venereal disease&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- in response to Mr. Trump's comment that Mr. McCain is not a war hero. A former Navy pilot, Mr. McCain spent about 5  1/2  years in a North Vietnamese prison known as the &quot;Hanoi Hilton,&quot; where he was repeatedly tortured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a political thing. This is a moral thing,&quot; said Ms. May, of Scranton. &quot;I have flaws. You have flaws. We aren't perfect but he (Trump) sets himself up in judgement over everybody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Sarsacary and Amber Hocter traveled from upstate New York to see Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They registered online Tuesday for tickets but weren't able to get inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're a little sad,&quot; said Mr. Sarsacary. Ms. Hocter said he wished there was an audio and visual element to the rally outside the venue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough with all the Donald Trump and Rob Ford comparisons, says Jimmy Kimmel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talk show host was in Montreal this past week for the Just for Laughs comedy festival and to be a judge on JeffRoss Presents Roast Battle (available for streaming at thecomedynetwork. ca).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a few other comedians, he drew the line at comparing the Republican presidential candidate to the late Toronto mayor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Canadians like to say that,&quot; says Kimmel, &quot;but let's not forget that Rob Ford was smoking crack. When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been &quot;a gift from the comedy gods.&quot; He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He does two crazy things every day,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he knew who I was,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was impressive, says Kimmel. &quot;I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he &quot;immediately fell deeply in love&quot; with Montreal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). &quot;We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,&quot; he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, &quot;played a lot of tennis back in his day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get &quot;too inside&quot; by assuming that the audience has seen your show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting offon the wrong foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He does two crazy things every day,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he knew who I was,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was impressive, says Kimmel. &quot;I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he &quot;immediately fell deeply in love&quot; with Montreal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers.

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh, June 8 -- Donald Trump's latest and ongoing fight with US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel who has Mexican lineage and the manner of the fight could have dangerous consequences not just for his pursuit for the White House but also for the prospects of the Republican Party (GOP) in elections to retain its majority in the Senate, when along with the presidential election on November 08, US voters will also elect 1/3 of the Senate seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, some of these leaders are deeply worried that the Party may even lose its commanding majority in the House of Representatives when a new House would also be elected on November 08. These leaders are seeing a parallel with what had happened in US politics in 1964. That year, the Republican Party candidate Barry Goldwater not only lost his bid to become the President to Lyndon Johnson, he also hurt the Party badly in other national elections like those in the Congress for years to come. Barry Goldwater had hurt the Republican Party by his anti-civil right stance that had totally alienated the African-Americans from the Republican Party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot has changed in US politics since then. The votes of the African-Americans are still important. However, the Latinos/Hispanics have moved ahead of the American Americans as the second largest voting bloc in US national elections. In 2012, after President Barack Obama had returned to power easily, the Republican Party establishment had run an internal assessment to pinpoint the reasons for their defeat. One major reason that emerged out of the assessment was the way the Latinos-Hispanics voted in that election. The Latinos-Hispanics had voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Democrats. Seventy-one per cent of the Latino-Hispanic votes went to President Barak Obama while 27 to Governor Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party had then concluded that unless it could increase its share of the Latino-Hispanic vote substantially in its favour, it would not have a fair chance of winning the White House. It further concluded that it would also face similar problems in elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives as well. Unfortunately, Donald Trump is not a Republican insider. He did not care for anything but the party's presidential ticket. He correctly assessed that in the Republican Party there is a big number of voters -- between 25-30 per cent -- who hate the Latinos/Hispanics, the blacks, the Muslims and the immigrants and if he aggressively insulted these groups, he would easily beat the 16 others who would be left to share the remaining 70 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what exactly happened. Thirty per cent plus a few or minus a few of Republican voters for whom hatred is a strong motivation found in Donald Trump their hero. The more venom he spread in his hate campaign, the more these voters backed him ultimately giving him the ticket with the Republican establishment leaders watching as bystanders. Their only hope since Donald Trump assured himself of the nomination has been that he would tone down his hate rhetoric. Instead of that happening, the case of his fight with Judge Curiel has devastated the Party's leadership because it has angered the country's Latino/Hispanic population even more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Curiel is linked with another dangerous development related to Donald Trump and his candidature. He is the Judge investigating the corruption in the Trump University. The way the case of the Trump University is developing, it has the potential of a dynamite to make his candidature history. Employees of the Trump University who have gone public have described it as a &quot;giant rip-off&quot; while the highest legal officer of New York State where the University is located has described it as a &quot;classic bait and switch scheme&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, it is out of fear of what Judge Curiel's investigation could reveal that Donald Trump attacked the Judge believing what is now his well-established style that attack is the best means of defence. Unfortunately, with the attack on the Judge, Donald Trump has further trashed the sentiments of the Latino-Hispanics. At this stage when he is going to be the Republican Party's candidate, the issue of his fight with Judge Curiel has appeared before the Republican Party leaders and conservative thinkers around the country as the virtual Red Flag. Thus, Newt Gingrich, former House Speaker urged Donald Trump to &quot;change his combative confrontation style before it is too late&quot;; House and Senate GOP leaders have condemned Donald Trump's remarks and &quot;donors have openly expressed their worry that losing Latino voters could doom them in key down-ballot races.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case with Judge Curiel is also significant as it is not just the Latino/Hispanics that Donald Trump has alienated. The attack has revealed his contempt for a system upon which a fundamental pillar of American democracy is based, namely that of the independence and impartiality of the judiciary. In attacking Judge Curiel, Donald Trump also said he would have said the same if the judge had been a Muslim. In the attack on Judge Curiel, Donald Trump has thus underlined that as president, his views on judges and the judiciary would depend on the racial and ethnic background of the judges and not on their intellect and integrity -- a very damning assessment of a fundamental institution of the country's democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, with Donald Trump as their candidate, the Republican Party leaders are in fear of not just losing the presidency; they are afraid that the adverse effects would be far worse. That fear was expressed by Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell who in an interview with CNN recently raised the Goldwater comparison. The Senator also made a point of what Donald Trump's hate campaign, particularly against the Latino/Hispanics is doing to the Republican Party. He said that when Ronald Reagan was elected, 84 per cent of US voters were white. That figure is now 70 per cent. He concluded from the comparison that it would be a huge mistake for the Republican Party to &quot;write off Latino Americans&quot; as Donald Trump is undoubtedly doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veteran Republican Party strategist Rick Wilson, expressing his anger on those GOP leaders who endorsed Donald Trump, wrote in a newspaper column: &quot;You own his politics. You own the racial animus that started out as a bug, became a feature and is now the defining characteristic of his campaign. You own every crazy, vile chunk of word vomit that spews from his mouth.&quot; He called upon the Party's leadership to ensure that Donald Trump would be sensible if it wanted to avoid the Goldwater effect that is now the Party's &quot;deepest fear&quot; that &quot;could last far longer than Donald Trump's political aspirations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation for the Republican Party leaders with Latino-Hispanic votes is now far worse than what it was in 2012 thanks entirely to Donald Trump. PEW Research Institute based in Washington DC in one of its latest research findings has stated that nearly 90 per cent Latino-Hispanics have now moved away from the Republican Party which would leave Donald Trump's chances of succeeding President Barack Obama very bleak indeed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Sarah Palin on Monday, February 1st, 2016 in an interview on CNN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RULING: FALSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do Donald Trump and Justin Bieber have in common?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humongous hair?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big bucks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about a case of abortion contortion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin compared their abortion stances during the Feb. 1 edition of CNN's The Lead. Jake Tapper asked the former Alaska governor and Trump supporter about Trump's turnabout on the issue of abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump is somebody who has clearly had different positions on issues that he has today,&quot; said Tapper. &quot;He called himself very pro-choice. Now he says he's very pro-life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am so glad Mr. Trump has seen the light,&quot; Palin responded, saying it was sad that anti-abortion groups were giving the candidate a hard time about his switch when other people who have had a change of heart on the issue have been celebrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She cited, as an example, singer Justin Bieber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tapper didn't quite understand and, in essence, asked her, what do you mean?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bieber &quot;has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him,&quot; Palin said. &quot;He's just one example.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wondered whether the pop star really had the same type of conversion as Trump or whether Palin had gone overboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's change of position on the abortion question is well-established. When Trump was first considering a third-party presidential run in 1999, he said on NBC's Meet the Press that although he hated the concept of abortion, &quot;I am pro-choice in every respect.&quot; By mid February 2011, when there was talk again that he would run for president, he declared, &quot;I am pro-life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the Biebs transitioned from abortion support to abortion opposition is not as clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We contacted Palin through her political action committee and sought comment from Bieber through the office of his manager, Scooter Braun. We didn't hear back from either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we decided to try to find out for ourselves. No pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only reference to the abortion issue we could find was Bieber's interview with Rolling Stone, published in February 2011. He was 16 at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really don't believe in abortion. I think (an embryo) is a human,&quot; Bieber told the magazine. &quot;It's like killing a baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was asked about abortion in cases of rape, his response was, &quot;Um. Well, I think that's really sad, but everything happens for a reason. I don't know how that would be a reason. I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rape comment in particular caused some controversy at the time, and since then Bieber has shied away from the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He got drawn back into it peripherally when his mother, Pattie Mallette, a born-again Christian, promoted a short anti-abortion film in 2013. Mallette had previously written of the pressure she experienced to have an abortion when she was 17 and carrying the now-pop superstar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chicago Sun-Times said in a Jan. 21, 2013, story that it had spoken with an unnamed &quot;longtime Bieber associate&quot; who claimed, &quot;I don't believe he agrees with his mom on this issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some might interpret that to mean that Bieber is now pro-abortion - which would signal a new position on abortion that, sorry, does not fit Palin's point. However, PolitiFact has a policy of not relying on unnamed or secondhand sources to speak for what others believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin said Bieber &quot;has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At PolitiFact, we believe it's the responsibility of the person making a claim to provide the evidence to back it up. Palin didn't respond to our query.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only reasonable conclusion at this point is that Bieber hasn't changed his position on abortion like Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, we never say never: If on-the-record evidence of Bieber supporting abortion prior to his Rolling Stone interview turns up, we'll consider a different ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until then, Palin's claim is not substantiated. We rate her claim False.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan. 22--Donald Trump's presidential campaign is a black-swan phenomenon. Nothing demonstrates this quite like so many commentators having egg on their faces for mistakenly predicting its demise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only reason I don't is that I have never underestimated the ignorance or gullibility of large segments of the American people. Such commentaries as &quot;On Syria (and almost Every Other Issue), the American People are Insolent, Ignorant, Idiots,&quot; September 10, 2013, attest to this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 10 percent of college graduates in the United States think that TV host Judith 'Judge Judy' Sheindlin sits on the Supreme Court, according to a recent study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(New York Post, January 19, 2016)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See? And that percent is probably five times higher among non-grads and high-school dropouts. In other words, this Trump phenomenon says more about far too many Americans than it does about him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump is nothing more than the P.T. Barnum of business: a huckster who thrives on the maxim that 'there's a sucker born every minute'...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only people who think Trump would make a good president are the suckers to whom he could sell swampland in the Florida Everglades as beachfront property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(&quot;Trump for President? Don't Be a Sucker,&quot; The iPINIONS Journal, April 8, 2011)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings me to the evangelicals and their incomprehensible support. I know evangelicals. As the son of an evangelical preacher, I grew up amongst them. So trust me when I say that, for any sober evangelical, Trump is the very personification of Mammon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, after all, is a man who takes diabolical pride in boasting that he never asks God for forgiveness because he's without sin; he's rich; and he's like a god himself. He even boasts that The Art of the Deal, his book about the virtues of greed and the salvation of wealth, rivals the Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to mention that he made most of his money building gambling casinos. Because gambling is as great a sin for most evangelicals as usury is for most Islamists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Trump is probably best known for building a gilded tower in New York City as a monument to himself. And, given his delusions of grandeur, one could well imagine him challenging Jesus by channeling the Devil from atop that tower as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the Devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 'If You bow down and worship me,' he said, 'I will give You all of this.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Matthew 4:8)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Jesus rebuked and then admonished the Devil to humble himself before God. You'd think evangelicals would do what Jesus did, especially given that Trump challenges their Christian faith almost every day. Instead of rebuking and admonishing him, however, they invariably hail him as if he were, well, the second coming of Jesus Christ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the case yesterday, when he held a rally at their Gethsemane, Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. Trump has an infamous and unrepentant record of iniquity; therefore, one might have expected evangelicals there to give him a proverbial stoning. Instead, they behaved as if Trump had channeled Daniel in the lion's den and cast a spell on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incidentally, this, from the conservative news site World Net Daily (on August 15, 2015), might explain why Trump is wooing evangelicals so successfully:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama isn't the Antichrist -- but he sure is 'paving the way' for him, said some Christian evangelists who've been watching the White House in biblically prophetic light with alarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(WND, August 15, 2015)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happened, Trump betrayed that he just might be the Antichrist when he bit his tongue trying to read a scripture from the Bible:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After vowing to protect Christians across the globe, Trump read a verse from Second Corinthians -- one of the books in the New Testament. But Trump flubbed the name, pronouncing it 'Two Corinthians.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(AOL News, January 18, 2016)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he does with everything, Trump boasts about the love evangelicals have for him. But they have clearly lost their way. It's a testament to just how far that more evangelicals are filling stadiums to hear Trump boast about his wealth than are filling churches to hear pastors preach about their God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only thing that explains this willful suspension of their evangelical faith is the precedent the lost Israelites set in Bible times:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exodus 32 relates that the Israelites, anxious about Moses' prolonged absence, demanded that provide a god to lead them. Complying, Aaron collected the golden ornaments of the people and fashioned the gold into the shape of a calf...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The image was immediately hailed by the people as a representation of the God who had brought Israel out of Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Jewish Virtual Library.org)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump is brazenly exploiting his &quot;relationship&quot; with evangelicals for all it's worth. Never mind that their relationship is based primarily on Trump boasting about his wealth and evangelicals hailing it as a representation of the God who will help Trump lead them down the primrose path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, it would be one thing if Trump troubled himself to show a little regard for their purported Christian values. But the feature attraction of his campaign rhetoric is mean-spirited, bullying, even profane language, which makes a mockery of those values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be fair, some evangelicals are more political conservatives than religious fanatics. But Trump, the New York liberal masquerading as a conservative, should be just as much a heathen as Trump, the apocalyptic Antichrist masquerading as a fanatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is why all evangelicals in this context are sacrificing their political ideology and/or Christian faith at the altar of Trump's egomaniacal ambition. And this does not even address the sacrilege inherent in Trump comparing himself to Ronald Reagan. After all, Reagan is like a god to political conservatives and religious fanatics alike, which is also incomprehensible. But I digress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is that, evangelicals seem drunk with wonder as they hang on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Trump. But I am constrained to ask: What will it profit an evangelical if he gains Trump as president, but loses his own soul?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a similar vein, Trump would do well to heed this admonition ... from God Himself:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Mathew 19:24)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evangelicals have always intoned that character matters. They would do well to be guided by this admonition when choosing a candidate to enter the White House.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton sought to wrest the spotlight from the Republican National Convention the other day, by taking her own campaign to Ohio and telling civil rights activists that Donald Trump cannot become president.Speaking at the NAACP convention in Cincinnati as the Republican jamboree opened a five-hour drive up the road, Clinton announced a nationwide drive to register millions of new voters to stop Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former secretary of state, who swept to victory in the Democratic primaries thanks to support from African Americans, painted her billionaire opponent as a threat to democracy, who lacks a policy platform and whose company refused to rent to blacks in the 1970s.&quot;Donald Trump plays coy with white supremacists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Donald Trump insults Mexican immigrants Donald Trump demeans women. Donald Trump wants to ban an entire religion from entering our country and Donald Trump loves to talk to the press,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump is to be anointed as Republican presidential nominee at the four-day convention in Cleveland by the party once led by Abraham Lincoln, the president who abolished slavery in the 19th century.Clinton told the conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which Trump declined to address, that the Republicans were becoming the party of Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a threat to our democracy and it all adds up to an undeniable conclusion Donald Trump cannot become president,&quot; she said to huge applause and delegates leaping to their feet.&quot;That's why we've got to work together to get the vote out this fall,&quot; she said, announcing a nationwide drive to get three million people registered to vote in the November 8 general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is customary for presidential candidates to address the NAACP convention but the presumptive Republican nominee snubbed an invitation to speak at the Cincinnati event.The Trump campaign gave no reason, as the candidate's wife Melania prepared to take the stage at the Republican convention later Monday, just 250 miles (400 kilometers) away in the same state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio is a key battleground state and Trump lost the Republican primary to Governor John Kasich. But a recent NBC News poll put Clinton and Trump tied at 39 percent with 21 percent of voters undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former US secretary of state used much of her speech to call for criminal justice reform, an end to systemic racism and to denounce the killing of police officers as totally unjustified.&quot;This madness has to stop,&quot; she said in reference to the attack Sunday that killed three police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana&quot;We have difficult, painful, essential work ahead of us to repair the bonds between our police and our communities, and between and among each other,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next president should make the commitment to fight for the reforms we so desperately need, holding police departments like Ferguson accountable,&quot; she said to deafening applause.The 2014 shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, unleashed widespread protests, some violent, about fatal police shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision not to indict the police officer prompted more protests across the country.Founded in 1909, the NAACP is America's oldest and largest civil rights organization, campaigning to end racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her voice cracking with emotion, Clinton also read from the Facebook post of Montrell Jackson, one of the officers killed in Louisiana on Sunday, who spoke of his hurt at being met with hostility when on duty, and viewed as a threat  as a black man  when out of uniform&quot;We have to heal the divides that remain, make the United States what it should be  stronger and fairer, more opportunity for everyone of our people,&quot; she said.The NAACP gave her a warm welcome on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the audience expressed disappointment that Trump chose to stay away and said Clinton appeared to be the candidate best suited to ending inequality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough with all the Donald Trump and Rob Ford comparisons, says Jimmy Kimmel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talk show host was in Montreal this past week for the Just for Laughs comedy festival and to be a judge on JeffRoss Presents Roast Battle (available for streaming at thecomedynetwork. ca).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a few other comedians, he drew the line at comparing the Republican presidential candidate to the late Toronto mayor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Canadians like to say that,&quot; says Kimmel, &quot;but let's not forget that Rob Ford was smoking crack. When Donald Trump picks up a crack pipe, then we'll have a comparison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel did concede that, like Ford, Trump has been &quot;a gift from the comedy gods.&quot; He has a theory as to why the campaigning billionaire seems to get away with one outrageous statement after another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He does two crazy things every day,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;Nothing sticks to him because we can't keep up with all this stuff. You can't even focus on one of them because by five o'clock that afternoon he's done something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel was saddened by the news of Ford's passing. The former mayor of Toronto died on March 22 at age 46. Ford and his brother Doug had flown to Los Angeles to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did get to know him and I did get to know his brother,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;Whatever you want to say about the guy, he really cared about being mayor and he really cared about doing a good job. Obviously he had his demons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Fords landed at Los Angeles International Airport en route to Kimmel's show, the host, dressed as a chauffeur, picked them up in a limo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he knew who I was,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;I do remember he spent the whole car ride on the phone, calling back constituents who had left him phone messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was impressive, says Kimmel. &quot;I wish his spirit would somehow fill the potholes on my drive to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel made his first appearance at Just for Laughs 19 years ago and says he &quot;immediately fell deeply in love&quot; with Montreal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard for people in America to understand that restaurants turn into nightclubs at the end of the meal. We usually have dessert and go home. In our restaurants, they don't move the tables and start dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 48, Kimmel is now one of the veteran players on the late-night scene. He's entering his 14th season hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live (weeknights on The Comedy Network). &quot;We're all working so much harder than anyone ever used to,&quot; he says, suggesting one of his idols, Johnny Carson, &quot;played a lot of tennis back in his day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we ruined the job for everyone by adding these viral videos and these sketches to the mix,&quot; says Kimmel. &quot;It used to be a reasonable job that you could go home at 6 o'clock at night and not think about the show until the next day. That has definitely changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Kimmel sketch that played for weeks on Facebook and YouTube - a song and dance number starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane - likened Trump's campaign to the Broadway farce The Producers. It looks like it took days to shoot but Kimmel says it was pulled together in an afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes you realize how much money they waste making these movies when you put something together so quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimmel's next challenge will come Sept. 18 when he'll be hosting the Emmy Awards, airing on ABC and CTV. The trick to hosting awards shows, he says, is not to get &quot;too inside&quot; by assuming that the audience has seen your show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if you approach it as if it's your show, instead of a show you're hosting, you're automatically getting offon the wrong foot.&quot; !@COPYRIGHT=&copy; 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc. All rights reserved.</SPAN></P>
